CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking statements relating to Chevron s operations and energy transition plans that are based on management s current expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other energy-related industries. Words or phrases such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, targets, advances, commits, drives, aims, forecasts, projects, believes, approaches, seeks, schedules, estimates, positions, pursues, progress, may, can, could, should, will, budgets, outlook, trends, guidance, focus, on track, goals, objectives, strategies, opportunities, poised, potential, ambitions, aspires and similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but not all forward-looking statements include such words. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the company s control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices and demand for the company s products, and production curtailments due to market conditions; crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing countries; technological advancements; changes to government policies in the countries in which the company operates; public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, and any related government policies and actions; disruptions in the company s global supply chain, including supply chain constraints and escalation of the cost of goods and services; changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which the company operates; general domestic and international economic, market and political conditions, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the war between Israel and Hamas and the global response to these hostilities; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; development of large carbon capture and offset markets; the results of operations and financial condition of the company s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company s joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company s operations due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, cyber threats, terrorist acts, or other natural or human causes beyond the company s control; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, investment or product changes undertaken or required by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change; the potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the ability to successfully integrate the operations of the company and PDC Energy, Inc. and achieve the anticipated benefits from the transaction, including the expected incremental annual free cash flow; the risk that Hess Corporation (Hess) stockholders do not approve the potential transaction, and the risk that regulatory approvals are not obtained or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated by the company and Hess; uncertainties as to whether the potential transaction will be consummated on the anticipated timing or at all, or if consummated, will achieve its anticipated economic benefits, including as a result of regulatory proceedings and risks associated with third party contracts containing material consent, anti-assignment, transfer or other provisions that may be related to the potential transaction that are not waived or otherwise satisfactorily resolved; the company s ability to integrate Hess operations in a successful manner and in the expected time period; the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits and projected synergies of the potential transaction will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the company s future acquisitions or dispositions of assets or shares or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, taxes and tax audits, tariffs, sanctions, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; higher inflation and related impacts; material reductions in corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; changes to the company s capital allocation strategies; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the company s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under the heading Risk Factors on pages 20 through 26 in this report, and as updated in the future. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

 General Development of Business 
 
 Summary Description of Chevron 
 Chevron Corporation, a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage, and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. 
 A list of the company s significant subsidiaries is presented in Exhibit 21.1 . 
 Overview of Petroleum Industry 
 Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns, the pace of energy transition and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations, select feedstocks, and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. 
 Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. 
 Operating Environment 
 Refer to Business Environment and Outlook of this Form 10-K in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company s current business environment and outlook. 
 Chevron s Strategic Direction 
 Chevron s strategy is to leverage our strengths to safely deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. Our objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. We are building on our capabilities, assets and customer relationships as we aim to lead in lower carbon intensity oil, products and natural gas, as well as advance new products and solutions that reduce the carbon emissions of major industries. We aim to grow our oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, carbon capture and offsets, hydrogen and other emerging technologies. 
 Information about the company is available on the company s website at www.chevron.com . Information contained on the company s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The company s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the company s website soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov . 

________________________________________________________ 
 Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term Chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we, us and "its" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include affiliates of Chevron i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or non-equity method investments. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.

Human Capital Management 
 Chevron invests in its workforce and culture, with the objective of engaging employees to develop their full potential to deliver energy solutions and enable human progress. The company hires, develops, and strives to retain a diverse workforce of high-performing talent, and fosters a culture that values diversity, inclusion and employee engagement. 
 The Chevron Way explains the company s beliefs, vision, purpose and values. It guides how the company s employees work and establishes a common understanding of culture and aspirations. 
 Chevron leadership is accountable for the company s investment in people and the company s culture. This includes reviews of metrics addressing critical function hiring, leadership development, retention, diversity and inclusion, and employee engagement. 
 The following table summarizes the number of Chevron employees by gender, where data is available, and by region as of December 31, 2023. 
 At December 31, 2023 Female Male Gender data not available 
 Total Employees Number of Employees Percentage Number of Employees Percentage Number of Employees Percentage Number of Employees Percentage Non-Service Station Employees U.S. 5,713 26 15,905 74 20 21,638 47 Other Americas 1,122 29 2,740 71 12 3,874 8 Africa 611 16 3,209 84 3 3,823 8 Asia 2,550 36 4,608 64 16 7,174 16 Australia 562 26 1,574 74 4 2,140 5 Europe 442 28 1,102 71 19 1 1,563 3 Total Non-Service Station Employees 11,000 27 29,138 72 74 40,212 88 Service Station Employees 2,392 44 2,011 37 985 18 5,388 12 Total Employees 13,392 29 31,149 68 1,059 2 45,600 100 
 Includes employees where gender data was not collected or employee chose not to disclose gender. 
 Hiring, Development and Retention 
 The company s approach to attracting, developing and retaining a global, diverse workforce of high-performing talent is anchored in a long-term employment model that fosters an environment of personal growth and engagement. The company s philosophy is to offer compelling career opportunities and a competitive total compensation and benefits package linked to individual and enterprise performance. The company recruits new employees in part through partnerships with universities and diversity associations. In addition, the company recruits experienced hires to provide specialized skills. 
 Chevron s learning and development programs are designed to help employees achieve their full potential by building technical, operating and leadership capabilities. The company s leadership regularly reviews metrics on employee training and development programs, which are refined on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of our business. The company invests in developing leadership at every level, including coaching programs for frontline supervisors, managers and individual contributors. 
 In addition, leadership regularly reviews the talent pipeline, identifies and develops succession candidates, and builds succession plans for key positions. The Board of Directors provides oversight of CEO and executive succession planning. 
 Management routinely reviews the retention of its professional population, which includes executives, all levels of management, and the majority of its regular employee population. The voluntary attrition for this population in 2023 was 2.9 percent, a decrease from five-year historical rates. The voluntary attrition rate generally excludes employee departures under restructuring programs. Chevron believes its low voluntary attrition rate is in part a result of the company s commitment to employee development, its long-term employment model, competitive pay and benefits, and its culture.

Diversity and Inclusion 
 Chevron believes human ingenuity has the power to solve difficult problems when diverse people, ideas and experiences come together in an inclusive environment. 
 Chevron also believes inclusive leadership development enhances performance and innovation. To that end, the company offers numerous leadership development programs, such as the Global Women s Leadership Development Program and Transformational Leadership for Multicultural Women, which are designed to provide forums for discussion of potential headwinds, promote professional growth, and foster a more inclusive work environment. 
 The company also strives to build an inclusive environment through innovative programs such as the company s MARC (Men Advocating Real Change) program launched in 2017, in partnership with the non-profit organization Catalyst, which is designed to facilitate discussions on gender equity in the workplace. MARC is active in over 35 Chevron locations on six continents around the world, with over 5,000 participants since inception. The success and impact of MARC led to the creation of Elevate in 2020, a program that seeks to take the inclusion dialogue beyond gender. 
 The company has 11 employee networks (voluntary groups of employees and allies that come together based on shared identity or interests) and a Chairman s Inclusion Council, which provides the employee network presidents with a direct line of communication to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, and the executive leadership team to collaborate and discuss how employee networks can reinforce the company s values of diversity and inclusion. Across many of its selection processes, the company continues to use specially trained company leaders as inclusion counselors, who help challenge group think and unconscious biases and provide outside perspectives when hiring for a position. 
 The company also aims to support a diverse and inclusive supply chain that is reflective of the communities where we operate. We believe that a diverse supply chain contributes to our success and growth. The company maintains long-standing partnerships with non-profit organizations, including the National Minority Supplier Development Council, Women s Business Enterprise National Council, National LGBT Chamber of Commerce and Disability:IN, that have helped many diverse businesses grow. 
 Employee Engagement 
 Employee engagement is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment to the company s values, purpose and strategies. The company regularly conducts employee surveys to assess the health of the company s culture. The company s survey frequency enables the company to understand employee sentiment throughout the year and gain insights into employee well-being. Our surveys indicate high levels of employee engagement. 
 Chevron prioritizes the health, safety and well-being of its employees. The company s safety culture empowers every member of its workforce to exercise stop-work authority without repercussion to address any potential unsafe work conditions. The company has set clear expectations for leaders to deliver operational excellence by prioritizing the safety and health of its workforce, and the protection of communities, the environment and the company s assets. Additionally, the company offers long-standing employee support programs such as Ombuds, an independent resource designed to equip employees with options to address and resolve workplace issues; a company hotline, where employees can report concerns to the Corporate Compliance department; and an Employee Assistance Program, a confidential consulting service that can help employees resolve a broad range of personal, family and work-related concerns.

Review of Ongoing Activities in Key Areas 
 Chevron has exploration and production activities in many of the world s major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron s 2023 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , are presented below. The comments include references to total production and net production, which are defined under Production in Exhibit 99.1 . 
 The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Projected start-up timing for nonoperated projects are per operator s estimate. 
 
 United States 
 Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, California, and the Gulf of Mexico. Acreage for the United States can be found in the Acreage table. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States can be found in the Net Production of Crude Oil, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas table. 
 As one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin, Chevron continues to develop its advantaged portfolio in west Texas and southeast New Mexico and is expected to achieve one million barrels of net oil-equivalent production per day in 2025. The asset is comprised of stacked formations enabling production from multiple geologic zones from single surface locations, staging the development for optimized capacity utilization of facilities and infrastructure. The company has implemented a factory development strategy utilizing multi-well pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are subsequently completed using hydraulic fracture stimulation. This manufacturing-style process, combined with advantaged acreage holdings and technological advancements, have enabled productivity improvements across unique geological locations throughout the basin. Acreage transactions enabling longer laterals and the company s diversified land assets via non-operated joint ventures and royalty positions have also contributed to higher returns in the Permian Basin. In August 2023, Chevron completed the acquisition of PDC, which added 25,000 net acres to our existing position in west Texas. In addition to ongoing emission reduction and water handling initiatives, a 50 percent joint venture solar power project in New Mexico became operational in 2023, with capacity to supply 20MW of renewable energy per day for nearby oil and gas operations. In 2023, Chevron s net daily production in the Permian Basin averaged 359,000 barrels of crude oil, 205,000 barrels of NGLs and 1.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 
 Chevron also holds approximately 72,000 net acres in the Haynesville Shale in east Texas. The company is evaluating strategic opportunities for these assets. 
 In Colorado, development is focused on the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin. The company follows a factory development strategy utilizing multi-well pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are subsequently completed using hydraulic fracture stimulation. It has also implemented facility design and electrification improvements to consolidate assets and remove facilities, which helped to reduce surface footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. In August 2023, Chevron completed the acquisition of PDC, which added 275,000 net acres that are largely adjacent to its existing operations. Following the acquisition, Chevron is now the largest oil and natural gas producer in the state with approximately 605,000 net acres in the DJ Basin. The company plans to optimize the combined acreage position to efficiently develop its resources. 
 In 2023, Chevron s net daily production in Colorado averaged 96,000 barrels of crude oil, 69,000 barrels of NGLs and 606 million cubic feet of natural gas. Chevron also has operations in Colorado s Piceance Basin, as well as an acreage position in Wyoming.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 As a global energy company, Chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the company s results of operations and financial condition. 
 BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS 
 Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The most significant factor that affects the company s results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions and level of economic growth, including low or negative growth; industry production and inventory levels; technology advancements, including those in pursuit of a lower carbon economy; production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers; weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control; competing fuel prices; geopolitical risks; the pace of energy transition; customer and consumer preferences and the use of 
 20 

Table of Contents 

substitutes; and governmental regulations, policies and other actions regarding the development of oil and gas reserves, as well as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. 
 Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company s upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company s credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in our business, including our Chevron New Energies organization. In some cases, transferred liabilities, including for abandonment and decommissioning of divested oil and gas assets, have returned and may continue to return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the company s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the company s own results of operations and financial condition depend. 
 The scope of Chevron s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, exploration or technology, the company s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of economic projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; technology advancements; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; partner alignment, including strategic support; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. 
 The company s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, other forms of severe weather, wildfires, ambient temperature increases, sea level rise, war or other military conflicts such as the war between Israel and Hamas and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases, some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. 
 Chevron s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. 
 Cyberattacks targeting Chevron s operational technology networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron s cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company s information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. The cyber risk landscape changes over time due to a variety of internal and external factors, including during political tensions, war or other military conflicts, or civil unrest. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the company s operational technology networks or other 
 21 

Table of Contents 

critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident. Further, the company is increasingly experiencing cyber incidents related to its third-party vendors. Some third-party vendors house the company s critical data and proprietary information on their IT systems, including the cloud; others have access to Chevron s IT systems or provide software through which threat actors could gain access or introduce malware to Chevron s IT systems. Regardless of the precise method or form, cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations. 
 The company s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevron s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the energy industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, standards, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. 
 The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident, series of events, or unforeseen liability for which the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition. 
 Chevron may not complete the acquisition of Hess Corporation within the time frame the company anticipates or at all, which could have adverse effects on Chevron The completion of the acquisition of Hess Corporation (Hess) is subject to a number of conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by Hess stockholders of the adoption of the merger agreement. Additionally, Hess and Chevron have been engaged in discussions with Exxon Mobil Corporation and China National Offshore Oil Corporation regarding a right of first refusal provision in the joint operating agreement for the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana. If these discussions do not result in an acceptable resolution and arbitration (if pursued) does not result in a confirmation that such right of first refusal provision is inapplicable to the merger, then there would be a failure of a closing condition under the Merger Agreement, in which case the merger would not close. For additional information, please see the section entitled The Merger Stabroek JOA in Chevron s preliminary registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed on February 26, 2024. 
 Further, on December 7, 2023, Chevron and Hess each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (Second Request) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in connection with the FTC s review of the merger. Issuance of the Second Request extends the waiting period imposed by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, until 30 days after Chevron and Hess have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by Chevron and Hess or terminated sooner by the FTC. 
 The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents for the acquisition that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the company s business after the transaction or materially delay the completion of the acquisition. A delay in completing the acquisition could cause the company to realize some or all of the benefits later than we otherwise expect to realize them if the acquisition is successfully completed within the anticipated timeframe, which could result in additional transaction costs or in other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the acquisition.

Acquisitions may cause Chevron s financial results to differ from the company s expectations or the expectations of the investment community, the company may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, and the acquisition may disrupt the company s current plans or operations The success of prior acquisitions, such as PDC Energy, Inc. (PDC), and the pending acquisition of Hess will depend, in part, on Chevron s ability to successfully integrate each of the businesses of PDC and Hess and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies. Difficulties in integrating PDC and Hess may result in the failure to realize anticipated synergies in the expected timeframes, in operational challenges, and in the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns, as well as in unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisitions, which may have an adverse impact on the company s financial results. 
 LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ESG-RELATED RISK FACTORS 
 Chevron s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron s operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action. For example, liability or delays could result from an accidental, unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the company s operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. 
 For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 16 Litigation . 
 Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevron s business The company s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing political, regulatory and economic environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company s partially or wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company s operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company s continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company s operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with sanctions and other trade laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate, such as sanctions imposed in Venezuela and Russia, which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company s operations and financial results in these countries. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products, could adversely affect the company s current or anticipated future operations and profitability. 
 Legislative or regulatory changes in tax laws may expose Chevron to additional tax liabilities Changes in tax laws and regulations around the world are regularly enacted due to political or economic factors beyond the company s control. Chevron s taxes in the jurisdictions where the company conducts business activities have been and may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or regulations, including but not limited to, substantive changes in, reductions in, or the repeal or expiration of tax incentives, such as U.S. federal tax incentives for biodiesel blending, which expire in 2024. Furthermore, Chevron s tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities around the world. There is no assurance that taxing authorities or courts will agree with the positions that Chevron has reflected on the company s tax returns, in which case interest and penalties could be imposed that may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition. 
 During periods of high profitability for certain companies or industries, there are often calls for increased taxes on profits, often called windfall profit taxes. Governments in various jurisdictions, including California and Australia, have announced, proposed, or implemented windfall profit taxes for companies operating in the energy and oil and gas sectors. Such taxes may be imposed on us or may be increased in the future in these or other jurisdictions. The imposition of, or 
 23 

Table of Contents 

increase in, such windfall profit taxes could adversely affect the company s current or anticipated future operations and profitability. 
 For information concerning the company s tax liabilities, see Note 17 Taxes and Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments . 
 Legislation, regulation, and other government actions and shifting customer and consumer preferences and other private efforts related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change could continue to increase Chevron s operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron s hydrocarbon and other products, resulting in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition Chevron has experienced and may be further challenged by increases in the impacts of international and domestic legislation, regulation, or other government actions relating to GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) and climate change. International agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of implementation. 
 Legislation, regulation, and other government actions related to GHG emissions and climate change could reduce demand for Chevron s hydrocarbon and other products and/or continue to increase Chevron s operational costs and reduce its return on investment. The Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries in which we operate have adopted and may adopt additional policies intended to meet their Paris Agreement goals. Globally, multiple jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program, performance standards or other mechanisms, or to attempt to indirectly advance reduction of GHG emissions through restrictive permitting, procurement standards, trade barriers, minimum renewable usage requirements, financing standards, standards or requirements for environmental benefit claims, increased GHG reporting and climate-related disclosure requirements, or tax advantages or other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy, fuel sources or lower-carbon technologies. For example, the company is currently subject to implemented programs in certain jurisdictions, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard program in the U.S., California s Cap-and-Trade Program and Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and newly approved mandates such as the California Air Resources Board Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, as well as other indirect regulation of GHG emissions, which may, among other things, ban or restrict technologies or products that use the company s products. GHG emissions that may be directly regulated through such efforts include, among others, those associated with the company s exploration and production of hydrocarbons; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil, natural gas and biofeedstocks into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction, and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and other products; and customers and consumers use of the company s hydrocarbon products. In addition, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) implements various incentives for lower carbon activities, including carbon capture and storage and the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. Although the IRA offers incentives that could support certain lower carbon lines of business, those same incentives could negatively impact supply and/or demand for our oil and gas products in the future or any existing or future lower carbon business lines. Many of these actions, as well as customers and consumers preferences and use of the company s products or substitute products, and actions taken by the company s competitors in response to legislation and regulations, are beyond the company s control. 
 Similar to any significant changes in the regulatory environment, climate change-related legislation, regulation, or other government actions may curtail profitability in oil and gas and lower carbon businesses, as well as render the extraction of the company s hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible. In particular, GHG emissions-related legislation, regulations, and other government actions, and shifting customer and consumer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing GHG emissions may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company s hydrocarbon-based products; increase demand for lower carbon products and alternative energy sources; make the company s products more expensive; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company s resources; impact or limit our business plans; and adversely affect the company s sales volumes, revenues, margins and reputation. For example, some jurisdictions are in various stages of design, adoption, and implementation of policies and programs that cap emissions and/or require short-, medium-, and long-term GHG reductions by operators at the asset or facility level, which may not be technologically feasible, or which could require significant capital expenditure, increase costs of or limit production, result in impairment of assets and limit Chevron s ability to cost-effectively reduce GHG emissions across its global portfolio. 
 The ultimate effect of international agreements; national, regional, and state legislation and regulation; and government and private actions related to GHG emissions and climate change on the company s financial performance, and the timing of 
 24 

Table of Contents 

these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, standardized carbon accounting, the extent to which Chevron would be able to receive, generate, or purchase credits, the price and availability of credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover, or continue to recover, the costs incurred through the pricing of the company s products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and government actions on the company s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes, including the actual laws and regulations enacted, the variables and trade-offs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes, and market conditions, including the responses of consumers to such changes. 
 Increasing attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters impacts our company Increasing attention to ESG matters, including those related to climate change and sustainability, increasing societal, investor and legislative pressure on companies to address ESG matters, and potential customer and consumer use of substitutes to Chevron s products have resulted and may continue to result in changes to the portfolio and company activities, increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof, negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets, impaired participation in public discourse and debate by the company relating to mandatory and voluntary standards and regulations, and damage to our reputation. For example, increasing attention to ESG matters, including climate change, may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional litigation and governmental investigations, or threats thereof, against the company. For instance, we have received investigative requests and demands from the U.S. Congress for information relating to climate change, methane leak detection and repair, and other topics, and further requests and/or demands are possible. At this time, Chevron cannot predict the ultimate impact any Congressional or other investigations may have on the company. Information related to climate-change related litigation matters is included in Note 16 Litigation under the heading Climate Change. 
 Some stakeholders, including but not limited to sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment funds, have been divesting and promoting divestment of or screening out of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Further, voluntary carbon-related and target-setting frameworks have developed, and continue to develop, that limit the ability of certain sectors, including the oil and gas sector, from participating, and may result in exclusion of the company s equity from being included as an investment option in portfolios. In addition, some stakeholders, including some of our investors, have divergent and evolving views on our ESG-related strategies and priorities, vis- -vis our lines of business, calling for focus on increased production of oil and gas products rather than new business lines and climate-related targets. These circumstances, among others, may result in pressure from activists on production; unfavorable reputational impacts, including inaccurate perceptions or a misrepresentation of our actual ESG policies, practices and performance; diversion of management s attention and resources; and proxy fights, among other material adverse impacts on our businesses. 
 In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters, including climate change and climate-related risks (including entities commonly referred to as raters and rankers ). Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings and investment community divestment initiatives, among other actions, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, evolving expectations on various ESG matters, including biodiversity, waste and water, have increased, and may continue to increase, costs, require changes in how we operate and lead to negative stakeholder sentiment. 
 Our aspirations, targets and disclosures related to ESG matters subject us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our reputation and stock price or result in other material adverse impacts to the company Chevron has announced an aspiration to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions in upstream by 2050. The company also has set nearer-term GHG emission-related targets for zero routine flaring, upstream carbon intensity, and portfolio carbon intensity. These and other aspirations, targets or objectives reflect our current plans and aspirations, and Chevron may change them for various reasons, including evolving market conditions; changes in our portfolio; and financial, operational, regulatory, reputational, legal and other factors. 
 Our ability to achieve any aspiration, target or objective, including with respect to climate-related initiatives, our lower carbon strategy outlined in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, pages 34 through 36, and any lower carbon new energy businesses, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the 
 25 

Table of Contents 

continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; (2) the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements, including changes to IPCC s Global Warming Potentials, affecting ESG standards or disclosures; (6) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals; (7) customers and consumers preferences and use of the company s products or substitute products; and (8) actions taken by the company s competitors in response to legislation and regulations. 
 The standards and regulations for tracking, reporting, marketing and advertising related to ESG matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time and may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period. 
 Our processes and controls may not always align with evolving voluntary standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, including through non-public processes, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. In addition, Chevron participates, along with other companies, institutes, universities, trade associations and other organizations, in various initiatives, campaigns, and other projects that express various ambitions, aspirations and goals related to climate change, emissions and energy transition. Chevron s individual ambitions, future performance or policies may differ from the ambitions of such organizations or the individual ambitions of other participants in these various initiatives, campaigns, and other projects, and Chevron may unilaterally change its individual ambitions, aspirations and goals. Achievement of or efforts to achieve aspirations, targets, goals and objectives such as the foregoing and future internal climate-related initiatives has, and may continue to, increase costs, and, in addition, may require purchase of carbon credits, or limit or impact the company s business plans, operations and financial results, potentially resulting in the reduction to the economic end-of-life of certain assets, impairing the associated net book value, among other material adverse impacts. Our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill such aspirations, targets, goals and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could have a negative impact on the company s reputation, investor sentiment, ratings outcomes for evaluating the company s approach to ESG matters, stock price, and cost of capital and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation, among other material adverse impacts. 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 Changes in management s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period In preparing the company s periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevron s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the company s business plans, general market conditions, the pace of energy transition, or changes in the company s outlook on commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses. 
 
 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
 None. 
 
 Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 Chevron s business and proprietary information, information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) networks are essential to its success. The company s cybersecurity program is designed to protect its information assets and operations from external and internal cyber threats by identifying and appropriately managing and mitigating risks while ensuring business resiliency. This program is integrated within the company s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, which is the company s systematic approach to identifying, managing and assessing major risks and safeguards, 
 26 

Table of Contents 

including cybersecurity risks. Chevron uses a risk-based information security process aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework to identify, prioritize and mitigate cyber risks. 
 The company s worldwide team of cybersecurity professionals undertakes a range of preemptive activities to protect its people, assets and reputation globally. The company also leverages internal and external resources to monitor cybersecurity threats to its systems and networks and to understand the broader threat environment. The company seeks to remove exploitable weaknesses in its systems or devices before they become a threat. Chevron security experts use automated threat intelligence feeds to increase vulnerability awareness, taking action to mitigate the highest risks. The company s cybersecurity guardrails, which are high-level design requirements expected to be built into any new digital solutions being deployed, are also updated on an ongoing basis to align with changes in industry standards and the evolving threat environment. 
 Chevron s cyber risk management process includes testing and risk assessments of technologies, third-party suppliers, and its IT and OT networks. These assessments ensure that our focus is on the highest priorities to maintain the security of our company s assets. To further protect the company s systems and data, Chevron s cybersecurity organization has threat intelligence capabilities to monitor security breaches impacting third-party suppliers. As third-party risks increase, the company s approach to third-party supplier risk management and qualification continues to evolve, including the ongoing expansion of its current supplier risk management program beyond IT vendors to other high-risk, third-party vendors. 
 Chevron s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) leads a global cybersecurity team that operationalizes and manages the company s cybersecurity program and strategy. Chevron s CISO has more than 20 years of cybersecurity experience and is responsible for providing a single and consolidated view of the company s enterprise cybersecurity risk. Before joining Chevron, he held a leadership role in cyber threat analysis with the U.S. Department of State s Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Chevron s CISO reports to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) who is responsible for Chevron s broader IT program, including resiliency and ability to remediate and recover from a cybersecurity incident to minimize impacts to the business and operations. He has more than 30 years of experience in IT and the oil and gas industry. 
 Chevron operates four Cyber Intelligence Centers around the world, some co-located with critical assets, with cyber professionals who monitor and respond to cyber threats 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to limit the scope and impact of cyber incidents in its networks. Chevron s CISO regularly receives cybersecurity operations reports detailing prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation efforts associated with cyber incidents, both on Chevron s networks and third-party supplier networks. The CISO has authority to mobilize a cross-functional cyber incident response team, including outside cybersecurity experts, to drive mitigation and remediation actions. Status updates on incidents are provided to senior management and to the Board, as appropriate. 
 The company s dedicated cyber risk organization meets regularly with business units to raise cyber risk awareness and keep diverse cybersecurity skill sets connected across the enterprise. Chevron has invested in broad cybersecurity awareness and required training to educate those with access to Chevron s networks on company policy and best practices. The company conducts regular phishing tests to train and assess its workforce s ability to identify malicious emails. 
 Chevron s Corporate Audit Department has a dedicated team responsible for IT and information security (including cybersecurity) audits. Chevron also leverages external resources to reinforce its cybersecurity capabilities. On a regular basis, external consultants provide a maturity assessment of the company s cybersecurity program. 
 The company s approach to managing risks, including cybersecurity risks, is embedded within the enterprise Operational Excellence (OE) Management System (OEMS). The OEMS provides a systematic process that enables the company to manage risk and implement safeguards and foster a culture of learning across different focus areas for Chevron s business, including cybersecurity. The company s Business Continuity Planning OE Process, a component of the OEMS, is designed to prepare Chevron to continue operations during an unplanned event or disruption, which aligns with its OE objective to prevent high-consequence security and cybersecurity incidents. Chevron works to identify critical business processes and dependent IT applications and document the processes for continuing operations without IT systems. Cross-functional teams also conduct regular multidisciplinary exercises, including an expansive cybersecurity exercise in 2023, to test and improve response plans. 
 The Board provides oversight of Chevron s cybersecurity program, receives reports from management on cybersecurity risks in connection with Chevron s operations and projects, and also reviews cybersecurity risks as part of the company s broader annual ERM process. In support of the Board s oversight of the company s policies and processes with respect to risk management and the company s major financial risk exposures, including cybersecurity, the Audit Committee meets with Chevron s CISO and CIO at least twice a year to review cybersecurity risks and implications, including the results of 
 27 

Table of Contents 

independent third-party assessments. The CISO and CIO present cybersecurity matters to the Board of Directors at least annually. The CISO and CIO also provide new Board members with a cybersecurity briefing as part of the onboarding process. In 2023, the Audit Committee hosted an external expert to discuss cybersecurity and digital risk management topics. 
 To date, the company has not experienced a cybersecurity threat or incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition; however, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees. Despite the cybersecurity measures that the company is taking to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that such measures will be sufficient to protect the company s systems, information, intellectual property and other assets from significant harm and that future cybersecurity incidents will not have a material adverse effect on the company or its results of operations or financial condition or cause reputational or other harm to the company. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 21 through 22 for further discussion of cyberattacks and the associated risks to Chevron s business.

 As previously disclosed, Chevron received correspondence from California s Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) seeking to resolve certain Notices of Violation (NOVs) related to alleged violations that occurred at Chevron s refinery in Richmond, California, between 2019 and 2022. The parties negotiated a resolution of the NOVs, including additional NOVs from the first half of 2023, in a settlement effective February 12, 2024. Resolution of these alleged violations will result in the payment of a civil penalty of 20 million. 
 
 As previously disclosed, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Office of Spill Prevention and Response (CDFW, OSPR) issued a Complaint - NOV to Chevron for alleged violations related to oil spills and impacted habitat and species occurring between January 2018 and May 2022 at different Chevron fields within Kern County, California. Chevron is negotiating a potential resolution of the NOVs with CDFW, OSPR. Resolution of the alleged violations will result in the payment of a civil penalty of 1.0 million or more. 
 As previously disclosed, the California Department of Conservation, California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM) (previously known as the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources) promulgated revised rules pursuant to the Underground Injection Control program that took effect April 1, 2019. Subsequent to that date, CalGEM issued NOVs and two orders to Chevron related to seeps that occurred in the Cymric Oil Field in Kern County, California. An October 2, 2019 CalGEM order seeks a civil penalty of approximately 2.7 million. Chevron has filed an appeal of this order. Chevron is currently in discussions with CalGEM regarding a settlement to resolve the order and all past and present seeps in the Cymric Field, which will increase the amount of penalty paid. 
 On March 17, 2022, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Harris County, Texas filed a civil lawsuit alleging violations of the Texas Clean Air Act in connection with a fire at Chevron s Pasadena, Texas refinery. The Pasadena refinery is currently negotiating a potential resolution that may result in the payment of a civil penalty of 1.0 million or more.

 Business Environment and Outlook 
 Chevron Corporation is a global energy company with direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates that conduct substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Venezuela. 
 The company s objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company s control. In the company s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance. 
 Governments, companies, communities and other stakeholders are increasingly supporting efforts to address climate change. International initiatives and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of design, adoption and implementation. These policies and programs, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix and the relative economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of jurisdiction-specific policies and programs can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements, the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities, the availability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits, the availability of suppliers that can meet sustainability and other standards, evolving regulatory or other requirements affecting ESG standards or other disclosures and evolving standards for tracking, reporting, marketing and advertising relating to emissions and emission reductions and removals. 
 Some of these policies and programs include renewable and low carbon fuel standards, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard program in the U.S. and California s Low Carbon Fuel Standard; programs that price GHG emissions, including 
 34 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Table of Contents 

California s Cap-and-Trade Program; performance standards, including methane-specific regulations such as the U.S. EPA s Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources; and measures that provide various incentives for lower carbon activities, including carbon capture and storage and the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. Requirements for these and other similar policies and programs are complex, ever changing, program specific and encompass: (1) the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels; (2) the purchasing, selling, utilizing and retiring of allowances and carbon credits; and (3) other emissions reduction measures including efficiency improvements and capturing GHG emissions. These compliance policies and programs have had and may continue to have negative impacts on the company now and in the future including, but not limited to, the displacement of hydrocarbon and other products and/or the impairment of assets. These policies have also enabled opportunities for Chevron in its lower carbon businesses. For example, the acquisition of Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG) in 2022 grew the company s renewable fuels production capacity and increased the company s carbon credit generation activities. Although we expect the company s costs to comply with these policies and programs to continue to increase, these costs currently do not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations. 
 Significant uncertainty remains as to the pace and extent to which the transition to a lower carbon future will progress, which is dependent, in part, on further advancements and changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. The level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and the amount of additional investments needed in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon capture and storage, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted, available technology options, customer and consumer preferences, the company s activities and market conditions. As discussed below, in 2021, the company announced planned capital spend of approximately 10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments. Although the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply for many years to come. 
 Chevron supports the Paris Agreement s global approach to governments addressing climate change and continues to take actions to help lower the carbon intensity of its operations while continuing to meet the demand for energy. Chevron believes that broad, market-based mechanisms are the most efficient approach to addressing GHG emission reductions. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as electric vehicle and renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. 
 The company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers and consumers demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology and customer and consumer preferences. Chevron aims to grow its oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, carbon capture and offsets, hydrogen and other emerging technologies. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company s capabilities, assets, partnerships and customer relationships. The company s oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon regulatory or market forces, among other factors. 
 In 2021, Chevron announced the following aspirations and targets that are aligned with its lower carbon strategy: 
 2050 Net Zero Upstream Aspiration Chevron aspires to achieve net zero for upstream production Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions on an equity basis by 2050. The company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other things, partnerships with multiple stakeholders including customers, continuing progress on commercially viable technology, government policy, successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based projects, availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable offsets in the global market, and granting of necessary permits by governing authorities. 
 2028 Upstream Production GHG Intensity Targets These metrics include Scope 1, direct emissions, and Scope 2, indirect emissions associated with imported electricity and steam, and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The 2028 GHG emissions intensity targets on an equity ownership basis include: 
 35 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Table of Contents 

Oil production GHG intensity of 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oil-equivalent (CO 2 e/boe), 
 Gas production GHG intensity of 24 kg CO 2 e/boe, 
 Methane intensity of 2 kg CO 2 e/boe, and 
 Flaring GHG intensity of 3 kg CO 2 e/boe. 
 The company also targets no routine flaring by 2030. Chevron uses emissions intensity targets, which enable the company to assess, quantify and transparently communicate its own carbon performance in a standardized way. 
 2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron s entire business. This metric encompasses the company s upstream and downstream business and includes Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company s PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) per megajoule (MJ) by 2028. 
 Planned Lower-Carbon Capital Spend through 2028 In 2021, the company established planned capital spend of approximately 10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon strategy, which includes approximately 2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its oil and gas operations, and approximately 8 billion for lower carbon investments in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. We anticipate additional capital spending as the company progresses toward its 2050 upstream production Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration and further grows its lower carbon business lines. 
 Since 2021, the company has spent 6.5 billion in lower carbon investments, including 2.9 billion associated with the acquisition of REG in 2022. 
 Chevron s goals, targets and aspirations reflect Chevron s current plans, and Chevron may change them for various reasons, including market conditions; changes in its portfolio; and financial, operational, regulatory, reputational, legal and other factors. Refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 20 through 26 for further discussion of GHG regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevron s business, including the risks impacting Chevron s lower carbon strategy and its aspirations, targets and plans. 
 Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted by both the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Additional information related to the company s effective income tax rate is included in Note 17 Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted in the United States on August 16, 2022, imposes several new taxes that were effective in 2023, including a 15 percent minimum tax on book income and a one percent excise tax on stock repurchases. The IRA also implements various incentives for lower carbon activities, including carbon capture and storage and the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, and extends the federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit through December 31, 2024. The IRA has not had a material impact on our results of operations. 
 In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued model rules for a new 15 percent global minimum tax (Pillar Two), and various jurisdictions in which the company operates enacted or are in the process of enacting Pillar Two legislation. Certain aspects of the tax under the Pillar Two framework will be effective beginning in 2024 in some jurisdictions and in 2025 (or later) in others. Although we do not currently expect that Pillar Two will have a material impact on our results of operations, we are continuing to evaluate the impact of legislative adoption by individual countries. 
 Supply Chain and Inflation Impacts The company is actively managing its contracting, procurement and supply chain activities to effectively manage costs and facilitate supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of the company s operational goals. Third party costs for capital and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company s control including, but not limited to: severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, global and local supply chain distribution issues, inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market-based prices charged by the industry s material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, which may result in a lag before the company s costs reflect changes in market trends.

While macroeconomic inflation is easing, trends in the costs of goods and services vary by spend category. The labor market remains tight, and suppliers are passing along wage rate increases for labor intensive operations. Chevron has applied inflation mitigation strategies in an effort to temper these cost increases, including fixed price and index-based contracts. Lead times for key capital equipment remain long. Chevron has addressed lead times by partnering with suppliers on demand planning, volume commitments, standardization and scope optimization. Raw material prices have declined, leading to a lower cost for drilling pipe, chemicals and construction materials. Onshore drilling activity in the United States declined; however, availability of specialized offshore drilling rigs, supply vessels and equipment to perform onshore hydraulic fracturing remains under pressure. 
 Refer to the Cautionary Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking Information on page 2 and to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company s results of operations or financial condition. 
 Acquisition and Disposition of Assets The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company s financial performance and value growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. In addition, some assets are sold along with their related liabilities, such as abandonment and decommissioning obligations. In certain instances, such transferred obligations have, and may in the future, revert to the company and result in losses that could be significant. In fourth quarter 2023, the company recognized an after-tax loss of 1.9 billion related to abandonment and decommissioning obligations from previously sold oil and gas production assets in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as companies that purchased these assets have filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and the company believes it is now probable and estimable that a portion of these obligations will revert to the company. The cash outlays for these abandonment and decommissioning obligations are expected to take place over the next decade. 
 Other Impacts The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning. 
 Earnings trends for the company s major business areas are described as follows: 
 Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by OPEC+ countries, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company s control, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. 
 The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company s ability to efficiently find, acquire and produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations. 
 The company has begun to experience regulatory challenges and delays in obtaining permits to conduct operations in certain jurisdictions. These challenges have, and may continue to, impact the company s plans for future investments. For example, during fourth quarter 2023, the company impaired a portion of its U.S. upstream assets, primarily in California, due to continuing regulatory challenges in the state that have resulted in lower anticipated future investment levels in its business plans. The company expects to continue operating the impacted assets for many years to come. 
 Chevron has interests in Venezuelan assets operated by independent affiliates. Chevron has been conducting limited activities in Venezuela consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to general licenses issued by the United States government. In fourth quarter 2022, Chevron received General License 41 from the United States government, enabling the company to resume activity in Venezuela subject to certain limitations, and the company continues such activities under this General License. The financial results for Chevron s business in Venezuela are being recorded as non-equity investments since 2020, where income is only recognized when cash is received and production and reserves are not included in the company's results. Crude oil liftings in Venezuela started in first quarter 2023, which have positively impacted the company s 2023 results, but future results remain uncertain.

Governments (including Russia) have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws, restrictions and regulations that could lead to disruption in our ability to produce, transport and/or export crude in the region around Russia. An adverse effect on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) operations could have a negative impact on the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan and the company s results of operations and financial position. The financial impacts of such risks, including presently imposed sanctions, are not currently material for the company; however, it remains uncertain how long these conditions may last or how severe they may become. 
 Chevron holds a 39.7 percent interest in the Leviathan field and a 25 percent interest in the Tamar gas field in Israel. In early October 2023, due to a war between Israel and Hamas, the Government of Israel directed the company to shut down production at the Tamar gas field. Approximately one month later, the company resumed production, and the Tamar gas field is currently operational. The Leviathan gas field was not impacted by the war and is currently operational. The financial impacts of the Tamar shutdown and other operational impacts were not material for the company. However, given the ongoing conflict, the future impacts on the company s results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain. 
 Commodity Prices The following chart shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged 83 per barrel for the full-year 2023, compared to 101 in 2022. As of mid-February 2024, the Brent price was 85 per barrel. The WTI price averaged 78 per barrel for the full-year 2023, compared to 95 in 2022. As of mid-February 2024, the WTI price was 77 per barrel. The majority of the company s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. 
 
 Crude prices were volatile in 2023 due to tapering of post-pandemic demand resurgence, OPEC+ supply cuts, Federal Reserve interest rate action, and the proliferation of geopolitical conflict. The company s average realization for U.S. crude oil and NGLs in 2023 was 59 per barrel, down 23 percent from 2022. The company s average realization for international crude oil and NGLs in 2023 was 72 per barrel, down 21 percent from 2022. 
 In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, prices for natural gas are also impacted by regional supply and demand and infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged 2.56 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2023, compared with 6.36 per MCF during 2022. High storage levels and strong production resulted in these lower prices. As of mid-February 2024, the Henry Hub spot price was 1.73 per MCF. (See page 45 for the company s average natural gas realizations for the U.S.) 
 Outside the United States, prices for natural gas also depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company s long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with some sold in the Asian spot LNG market. International natural gas realizations averaged 7.69 per MCF during 2023, compared with 9.75 per MCF during 2022, mainly due to lower LNG prices. 
 Production The company s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2023 was 3.1 million barrels per day, 4 percent higher than in 2022 primarily due to the acquisition of PDC Energy, Inc. (PDC) and growth in the Permian Basin. About 26 percent of the company s net oil-equivalent production in 2023 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Republic of Congo.

The company estimates its net oil-equivalent production in 2024 to increase four to seven percent over 2023, assuming a Brent crude oil price of 80 per barrel and including expected asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; acquisition and divestment of assets; fluctuations in demand for crude oil and natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic conditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. The company has increased its investment emphasis on short-cycle projects. 
 
 Proved Reserves Net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 11.1 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end 2023, a slight decrease from year-end 2022. The reserve replacement ratio in 2023 was 86 percent. The 5 and 10 year reserve replacement ratios were 82 percent and 99 percent, respectively. Refer to Table V for a tabulation of the company s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2021 and each year-end from 2021 through 2023, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2023. 
 Refer to the Results of Operations section on pages 41 and 42 for additional discussion of the company s upstream business. 
 Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, petrochemicals and renewable fuels. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events. 
 Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company s control include the general level of inflation and energy

 U.S. upstream earnings decreased by 8.5 billion primarily due to lower realizations of 6.2 billion, 1.9 billion in charges related to abandonment and decommissioning obligations for previously sold oil and gas producing assets in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and higher impairment charges of 1.8 billion, mainly from assets in California. Partially offsetting these items are higher sales volumes of 1.9 billion. Higher 2023 operating expenses of 460 million were more than offset by the absence of a 2022 early contract termination at Sabine Pass of 600 million. 
 Net oil-equivalent production was up 168,000 barrels per day, or 14 percent, primarily due to the acquisition of PDC and growth in the Permian Basin.

Millions of dollars 2023 2022 2021 Taxes other than on income 4,220 4,032 3,963 
 Taxes other than on income increased in 2023 primarily due to higher excise taxes. 
 Millions of dollars 2023 2022 2021 Interest and debt expense 469 516 712 
 Interest and debt expenses decreased in 2023 mainly due to higher capitalized interest and lower debt balances. 
 Millions of dollars 2023 2022 2021 Other components of net periodic benefit costs 212 295 688 
 Other components of net periodic benefit costs decreased in 2023 primarily due to lower pension settlement costs as fewer lump-sum pension distributions were made in the current year, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. 
 Millions of dollars 2023 2022 2021 Income tax expense (benefit) 8,173 14,066 5,950 
 The decrease in income tax expense in 2023 of 5.9 billion is due to the decrease in total income before tax for the company of 20.1 billion. The decrease in income before taxes for the company is primarily the result of lower upstream realizations and downstream margins. 
 U.S. income before tax decreased from 21.0 billion in 2022 to 8.6 billion in 2023. This 12.4 billion decrease in income was primarily driven by lower upstream realizations and downstream margins, charges related to abandonment and decommissioning obligations, and higher impairment charges, partially offset by higher sales volumes. The decrease in income had a direct impact on the company s U.S. income tax resulting in a decrease to tax expense of 2.7 billion between year-over-year periods, from 4.5 billion in 2022 to 1.8 billion in 2023. 
 International income before tax decreased from 28.7 billion in 2022 to 21.0 billion in 2023. This 7.7 billion decrease in income was primarily driven by lower upstream realizations, partly offset by the absence of a 2022 write-off and impairment charges. The decrease in income primarily drove the 3.2 billion decrease in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from 9.6 billion in 2022 to 6.4 billion in 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Cash The strength of the company s balance sheet enables it to fund any timing differences throughout the year between cash inflows and outflows. 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Total balances were 8.2 billion and 17.9 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The company holds its cash with a diverse group of major financial institutions and has processes and safeguards in place designed to manage its cash balances and mitigate the risk of loss. Cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was 35.6 billion, compared to 49.6 billion in 2022, primarily due to lower upstream realizations and refining margins. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately 1.1 billion in 2023 and 1.3 billion in 2022. Capital expenditures totaled 15.8 billion in 2023 compared to 12.0 billion in 2022. Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and return of investments totaled 669 million in 2023 compared to 2.6 billion in 2022 . Cash flow from financing activities includes proceeds from shares issued for stock options of 261 million in 2023, compared with a higher than typical 5.8 billion in 2022 when a large number of stock options were exercised. 
 Restricted cash of 1.1 billion and 1.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as Deferred charges and other assets and Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments and funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges. 
 Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were 11.3 billion in 2023 and 11.0 billion in 2022. 
 Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities Total debt and finance lease liabilities were 20.8 billion at December 31, 2023, down from 23.3 billion at year-end 2022. 
 The 2.5 billion decrease in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2023 was primarily due to the repayment of long-term notes that matured during the year. The company s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of the current portion of long-term debt and redeemable long-term obligations, totaled 5.1 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with 6.0 billion at year-end 2022. Of these amounts, 4.5 billion and 4.1 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2023 and 2022, respectively. At year-end 2023, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2024, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. 
 During third quarter 2023, the company assumed 1.5 billion of debt in conjunction with the PDC acquisition, including balances outstanding under the revolving credit facility, PDC s 6.125 notes due 2024 (2024 notes) and PDC s 5.75 notes due 2026 (2026 notes). The outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility and the 2024 notes were repaid during third quarter 2023. The company also irrevocably deposited sufficient U.S. Treasury securities with U.S. Bank Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, to fund the redemption of the 2026 notes, resulting in the indenture being satisfied and discharged. 
 The company has access to a commercial paper program as a financing source for working capital or other short-term needs. The company had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023.

The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company s debt, and the company s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA), Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble), and Texaco Capital Inc. Most of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA- by Standard and Poor s Corporation and Aa2 by Moody s Investors Service. The company s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor s and P-1 by Moody s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. 
 The company s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions, the capital program, lending commitments to affiliates and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company has the ability to modify its capital spending plans and discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program. This provides the flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and remain committed to retaining the company s high-quality debt ratings. 
 Committed Credit Facilities Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 19 Short-Term Debt .

 Common Stock Repurchase Program In first quarter 2023, the company purchased a total of 22.4 million shares for 3.7 billion under the February 2019 stock repurchase program. On January 25, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of the company s shares of common stock in an aggregate amount of 75 billion (the 2023 Program ). The 2023 Program took effect on April 1, 2023, and does not have a fixed expiration date. As of December 31, 2023, the company had purchased a total of 70.4 million shares for 11.2 billion, resulting in 63.8 billion remaining under the 2023 Program. In aggregate, the company purchased 92.8 million shares for 14.9 billion in 2023. In connection with the pending transaction with Hess, share repurchases have been restricted pursuant to SEC regulations since the acquisition announcement and will be restricted until the date of the Hess stockholder vote. Chevron expects share repurchases in the first quarter of 2024 to be around 3 billion plus or minus 20 percent, depending primarily on the timing of the Hess definitive proxy statement mailing. 
 Repurchases of shares of the company s common stock may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 
 Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures (Capex) primarily includes additions to fixed asset or investment accounts for the company s consolidated subsidiaries and is disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Capex by business segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:

Total Upstream 9,842 3,836 13,678 6,847 2,718 9,565 4,554 2,221 6,775 Downstream 1,536 237 1,773 1,699 375 2,074 806 234 1,040 All Other 351 27 378 310 25 335 221 20 241 Capex 11,729 4,100 15,829 8,856 3,118 11,974 5,581 2,475 8,056 
 Capex for 2023 was 15.8 billion, 32 percent higher than 2022 due to higher investments in the United States, including about 450 million invested in PDC assets post-acquisition and approximately 650 million of inorganic spend, mainly due to the acquisition of a majority stake in ACES Delta, LLC. Capex excludes the acquisition cost of PDC. 
 The company estimates that 2024 Capex will be approximately 16 billion. In the upstream business, Capex is estimated to be 14 billion, two-thirds of which is expected to be in the U.S., and includes around 5 billion for Permian Basin development and roughly 1.5 billion for other shale tight assets in the U.S. About 25 percent of U.S upstream Capex is planned for projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Worldwide downstream spending in 2024 is estimated to be 1.5 billion with 80 percent allocated in the U.S. In addition, investments in technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2024 are projected to be about 0.5 billion. Lower carbon Capex included in the upstream and downstream segments totals around 2 billion, including investments to lower the carbon intensity of Chevron s traditional operations and grow new energy business lines. 
 
 Affiliate Capital Expenditures Equity affiliate capital expenditures (Affiliate Capex) primarily includes additions to fixed asset and investment accounts in the equity affiliate companies financial statements and does not require cash outlays by the company. 
 Affiliate Capex by business segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:

Financial Ratios and Metrics 
 The following represent several metrics the company believes are useful measures to monitor the financial health of the company and its performance over time: 
 Current Ratio Current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods is adversely affected by the fact that Chevron s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2023, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately 6.5 billion. 
 At December 31 Millions of dollars 2023 2022 2021 Current assets 41,128 50,343 33,738 Current liabilities 32,258 34,208 26,791 Current Ratio 1.3 1.5 1.3 
 Interest Coverage Ratio Income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. 
 Year ended December 31 Millions of dollars 2023 2022 2021 Income (Loss) Before Income Tax Expense 29,584 49,674 21,639 Plus: Interest and debt expense 469 516 712 Plus: Before-tax amortization of capitalized interest 223 199 215 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 42 143 64 Subtotal for calculation 30,234 50,246 22,502 Total financing interest and debt costs 617 630 775 Interest Coverage Ratio 49.0 79.8 29.0

 Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk 
 The market risk associated with the company s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors . 
 51 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Table of Contents 

Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, NGLs, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, NGLs, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2023. 
 The company s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company s risk management policies. The company s risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the company s Board of Directors. 
 Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron s derivative commodity instruments in 2023 was not material to the company s results of operations. 
 The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value, at the 95 percent confidence level with a one-day holding period, from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was not material to the company s cash flows or results of operations. 
 Foreign Currency The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2023. 
 Interest Rates The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2023, the company had no interest rate swaps. 
 
 Transactions With Related Parties 
 Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to Other Information in Note 15 Investments and Advances for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Table of Contents 

environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately 13.8 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2023 is related primarily to upstream properties. 
 For the company s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise decommission the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. 
 Refer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company s 2023 environmental expenditures. Refer to Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments for additional discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves, and for abandonment and decommissioning obligations for previously sold assets. Refer also to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussion of the company s asset retirement obligations. 
 Suspended Wells Information related to suspended wells is included in Note 21 Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells . 
 Income Taxes Information related to income tax contingencies is included in Note 17 Taxes and in Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading Income Taxes. 
 Other Contingencies Information related to other contingencies is included in Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading Other Contingencies. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 The company is subject to various international and U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Consideration of environmental issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the company s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve in many jurisdictions where we operate. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company s results of operations or financial condition. Refer to Business Environment and Outlook on pages 34 through 36 for a discussion of legislative and regulatory efforts to address climate change. 
 Most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials; or comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity or financial position. 
 Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards. 
 Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2023 at approximately 2.5 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately 0.5 billion of environmental capital expenditures and 2.0 billion of costs associated 
 53 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Table of Contents 

with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the decommissioning and restoration of sites. 
 For 2024, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at 0.5 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions 
 Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on management s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. 
 The discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the SEC, wherein: 
 1. the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and 
 2. the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company s financial condition or operating performance is material. 
 The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed critical, and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows: 
 Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. 
 The estimates of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron s Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following: 
 1. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD A) - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During 2023, Chevron s UOP DD A for oil and gas properties was 10.8 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2023 were 6.5 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by five percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD A in 2023 would have increased by approximately 600 million. 
 2. Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below. 
 Refer to Table V , Proved Reserve Quantity Information, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for each of the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, and to Table VII , Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Table of Contents 

This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , which includes a description of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities. 
 Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value. 
 Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, NGLs, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company s business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 18 Properties, Plant and Equipment and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . 
 The company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company s crude oil, NGLs or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets associated carrying values. 
 Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company s carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable. 
 A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company s PP E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets. 
 Asset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2023 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company s long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations. 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the company s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions. 
 55 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Table of Contents 

The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the company s processes to develop these assumptions is included in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company s control. 
 For 2023, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.0 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 5.2 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 5.0 percent for the primary U.S. pension plan. The actual return for 2023 was 10.9 percent. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2023, actual asset returns averaged 5.3 percent for this plan. Additionally, with the exception of three years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 7.0 percent during each year. 
 Total pension expense for 2023 was 557 million. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a one percent increase in this assumption for the company s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 55 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2023 by approximately 78 million. A one percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2023 by approximately 105 million. 
 The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2023, was a net liability of approximately 1.5 billion. An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2023, the company used a discount rate of 5.0 percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 65 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately 279 million, and would have changed the plan s funded status from a deficit of 80 million to a surplus of 199 million. 
 For the company s OPEB plans, expense for 2023 was 86 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2023, was 2.0 billion. For the primary U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 5.3 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 5.1 percent to measure expense in 2023, and a 5.0 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31, 2023. Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on 2023 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2023. 
 Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 93 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans for more information on the 3.7 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2023. In addition, information related to company contributions is included on page 96 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the heading Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments. 
 Business Combinations Purchase-Price Allocation Accounting for business combinations requires the allocation of the company s purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their respective fair values. The company uses all available information to make these fair value determinations. Determining the fair value of assets acquired generally involves assumptions regarding the amounts and timing of future revenues and expenditures, as well as discount rates. For additional discussion of purchase price allocations, refer to Note 29 Acquisition of PDC Energy, Inc. 
 Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters, transferred liabilities from previously sold assets, and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology. 
 Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as Operating expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses or Other income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is

For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading Income Taxes. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2023. 
 An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. For further information, refer to Changes in management s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period in Item 1A. Risk Factors , on page 26.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Chevron Corporation 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 As described in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded PDC Energy, Inc. (PDC) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 because it was acquired by the Company in a business combination during 2023. We have also excluded PDC from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. PDC is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent five percent and one percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
 
 60 

Financial Table of Contents 

transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 The Impact of Proved Developed Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net 
 As described in Notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s upstream property, plant and equipment, net balance was 135.0 billion as of December 31, 2023, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was 15.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. As disclosed by management, variables impacting the Company s estimated volumes of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. Reserves are estimated by Company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the Company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) (the Company s earth scientists, engineers and RAC are collectively referred to as management s specialists ). 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves on upstream property, plant, and equipment, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of management s specialists, when developing the estimates of proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the data, methods and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s estimates of proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves. The work of management s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves. As a basis for using this work, the specialists qualifications were understood and the Company s relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists findings related to estimated future production volumes by comparing the estimate to relevant historical and current period information, as applicable.

 Descriptions of major equity affiliates and non-equity investments, including significant differences between the company s carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows: 
 Tengizchevroil Chevron has a percent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan. At December 31, 2023, the company s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO s net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a principal balance of . 
 Caspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak. 
 Angola LNG Limited Chevron has a percent interest in Angola LNG Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets. 
 Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. Included in the investment balance is a loan with a principal balance of to fund a portion of the Golden Triangle Polymers Project in Orange, Texas, in which Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC owns percent. 
 GS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea. The joint venture imports, produces and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants.

 billion. In 2017, Chevron obtained a final court ruling in the United States determining that the Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption, and prohibiting the Ecuadorian plaintiffs and their cohorts from seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in the United States or profiting from their illegal acts. The Ecuadorian plaintiffs sought to have the Ecuadorian judgment recognized and enforced in Canada, Brazil, and Argentina, but all of those actions were dismissed in Chevron s favor. 
 In 2009, Chevron filed an arbitration claim against Ecuador before an arbitral tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. In 2018, the tribunal ruled in Chevron s favor, finding that the Ecuadorian judgment was procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption and was based on environmental claims that Ecuador had already settled and released. The tribunal ruled that the Ecuadorian judgment violates international public policy and should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other States, and ordered Ecuador to remove the judgment s status of enforceability and to compensate Chevron for its injuries in an amount to be established separately by the tribunal. Ecuador s requests to have a Dutch court set aside the tribunal s award were denied, and the Dutch Supreme Court affirmed such denial in a final ruling in favor of Chevron in November 2023. 
 Management continues to believe that the Ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable and will vigorously defend against any further attempts to have it recognized or enforced.

separate lawsuits filed by various U.S. cities and counties, U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Native American tribes, and a trade group in both federal and state courts. 1 One of the city lawsuits was dismissed on the merits and suits, including of the county lawsuits and the case brought by the trade association, were voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs. The lawsuits have asserted various causes of action, including public nuisance, private nuisance, failure to warn, fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, design defect, product defect, trespass, negligence, impairment of public trust, equitable relief for pollution, impairment and destruction of natural resources, unjust enrichment, violations of consumer protection statutes, violations of unfair competition statutes, violations of a federal antitrust statute, and violations of federal and state RICO statutes, based upon, among other things, the company s production of oil and gas products and alleged misrepresentations or omissions relating to climate change risks associated with those products. Further such proceedings are likely to be brought by other parties. While defendants have sought to remove cases filed in state court to federal court, most of those cases have been remanded to state court and the U.S. Supreme Court has denied petitions for writ of certiorari on jurisdictional questions to date. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings include claims for damages (both compensatory and punitive), injunctive and other forms of equitable relief, including without limitation abatement, contribution to abatement funds, disgorgement of profits and equitable relief for pollution, impairment and destruction of natural resources, civil penalties and liability for fees and costs of suits. Due to the unprecedented nature of the suits, the company is unable to estimate any range of possible liability, but given the uncertainty of litigation there can be no assurance that the cases will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change and will vigorously defend against such proceedings.

coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed lawsuits in Louisiana against numerous oil and gas companies seeking damages for coastal erosion in or near oil fields located within Louisiana s coastal zone under Louisiana s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA). Chevron entities are defendants in of these cases. 2 The lawsuits allege that the defendants historical operations were conducted without necessary permits or failed to comply with permits obtained and seek damages and other relief, including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations. Further such proceedings may be filed by other parties. The Supreme Court denied a petition for writ of certiorari on jurisdictional questions impacting certain of these cases, and those cases have been or will be remanded to Louisiana state court. Federal jurisdictional questions are still being decided for the remaining cases in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. A case has been set for trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana and is scheduled to begin in October 2024. Due to the unprecedented nature of the suits, the company is unable to estimate any range of possible liability, but given the uncertainty of litigation there can be no assurance that the cases will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that the claims lack legal and factual merit and will continue to vigorously defend against such proceedings.

 The 2023 decrease in income tax expense of is a result of the year-over-year decrease in total income before income tax expense, which is primarily due to lower upstream realizations and downstream margins. The company s effective tax rate changed from percent in 2022 to percent in 2023. The change in effective tax rate is mainly due to mix effects resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions.

 Deferred tax liabilities increased by from year-end 2022, driven by an increase to properties, plant and equipment. Deferred tax assets increased by from year-end 2022. This increase was primarily related to increases in foreign tax credits and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in tax loss carryforwards and employee benefits. 
 The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. The valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management s assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2023, the company had gross tax loss carryforwards of approximately and tax credit carryforwards of approximately , primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2024 through 2042.

 Income taxes, including U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes, are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely, or where no taxable temporary differences exist that are attributable to unremitted earnings from an investment in a foreign entity. The indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for U.S. state and foreign withholding tax purposes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.

 Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date. 
 The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2023, the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt. 
 At December 31, 2023, the company had in -day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities allow the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year. This supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facility would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company s strong credit rating. borrowings were outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2023. 
 and of short-term debt as long-term at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.

 On May 25, 2022, stockholders approved the Chevron 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2022 LTIP). Awards under the 2022 LTIP may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and non-stock grants. From May 2022 through May 2032, no more than million shares may be issued under the 2022 LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 25, 2022, no more than million of those shares may be issued in the form of full value awards such as share-settled restricted stock, share-settled restricted stock units and other share-settled awards that do not require full payment in cash or property for shares underlying such awards by the award recipient. For the major types of awards issued before January 1, 2017, the contractual terms vary between for the performance shares and restricted stock units, and years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. For awards issued after January 1, 2017, contractual terms vary between for the performance shares and special restricted stock units, for standard restricted stock units and years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. Commencing for grants issued in January 2023 and after, standard restricted stock units vest ratably on an annual basis over a period. Forfeitures of performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are recognized as they occur. Forfeitures of stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990.

 The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense. 
 Discount Rate The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company s plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis were percent, percent, and percent for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, for both the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans.

 The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management. 
 The company s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established. 
 For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company s Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities percent, Fixed Income percent, Real Estate percent, Alternative Investments percent and Cash percent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines: Equities percent, Fixed Income percent, Real Estate percent, and Cash percent. The other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and liquidity constraints. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds. 

and to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In 2024, the company expects contributions to be approximately to its U.S. plans and to its international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments, tax law changes and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.

 and at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, with a majority of the allowance relating to non-trade receivable balances. 
 The majority of the company s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of at December 31, 2023, which reflects the company s diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company s broad worldwide customer base. As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring prepayments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral. Once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists, the company applies a quantitative calculation to current trade receivable balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis, including probability of default and loss given default, which takes into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company s historical loss data. This statistical approach becomes the basis of the company s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days. 
 Chevron s non-trade receivable balance was at December 31, 2023, which includes receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review. This management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts. Non-trade receivables also include employee and tax receivables that are deemed immaterial and low risk. Loans to equity affiliates and non-equity investees are also considered non-trade and associated allowances of and at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, are included within Investments and advances on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair value. Provisional fair value measurements were made for acquired assets and liabilities, and adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the date of acquisition, as information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. Oil and gas properties were valued using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporated internally generated price assumptions and production profiles together with appropriate operating cost and development cost assumptions. Debt assumed in the acquisition was valued based on observable market prices for PDC s debt. As a result of measuring the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at fair value, there was no goodwill or bargain purchase recognized.

 Reserves Governance The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resources classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by a number of organizations, including the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum Congress and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The company classifies discovered recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves: probable and possible. The potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards. 
 Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate. 
 Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available. 
 106 

Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited Financial Table of Contents 

Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the Manager of Global Reserves, an organization that is separate from the business units that estimate reserves. The Manager of Global Reserves has more than 30 years of experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and graduate degrees in geoscience. His experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects, and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves processes. He has been named a Distinguished Lecturer by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and is an active member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the SEPM Society of Sedimentary Geologists and the Society of Petroleum Engineers. 
 All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates. 
 The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the business units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve quantities are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the Chevron Corporation Reserves Manual , which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves. 
 During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company s business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company s senior leadership team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company s annual reserves activity is also reviewed with the Board Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board. 
 RAC sub-teams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the Chevron Corporation Reserves Manual . 
 Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2023, additions to Chevron s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide reasonably certain proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates.

 In 2023, revisions include a net decrease of 407 million BOE in the United States. Revisions in Midland and Delaware basins yielded a decrease of 275 million BOE mainly due to a decrease of 186 million BOE from portfolio optimization and a reduction of 74 million BOE from reservoir performance. Reduced development activities contributed to a net decrease of 114 million BOE in east Texas and California. In Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, performance-driven reservoir model changes led to a net decrease of 107 million BOE to proved undeveloped reserves with a largely offsetting increase

to proved developed reserves in existing wells. These reductions were partially offset by an increase of 49 million BOE in Israel mainly due to the final investment decision on a new gas pipeline project. 
 In 2023, extensions and discoveries of 258 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the Midland and Delaware basins of 173 million BOE and the DJ basin of 49 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the Gulf of Mexico of 36 million BOE. In Other Americas, 57 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina. 
 In 2023, purchases of 301 million BOE in the United States are primarily from the acquisition of PDC. 
 The difference in 2023 extensions and discoveries of 127 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 441 million BOE as reflected on pages 110 to 112 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 314 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2023. 
 Transfers to proved developed reserves in 2023 include 395 million BOE in the United States, primarily from 268 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 83 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 44 million BOE in the Gulf of Mexico. Other significant transfers to proved developed are 114 million BOE in Israel and a combined 87 million BOE in Bangladesh, Argentina, Canada, Kazakhstan, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities. 
 During 2023, investments totaling approximately 9.1 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about 0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about 5.0 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico. In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled approximately 2.5 billion, primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan. An additional 0.3 billion were spent on development activities in Australia. In Africa, about 0.7 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about 0.6 billion of expenditures. 
 Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels. 
 At year-end 2023, the company held approximately 1 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 235 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the Gorgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 137 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 650 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 575 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. Approximately 511 million BOE are related to TCO in Kazakhstan and about 64 million BOE are related to Angola LNG. At TCO and Angola LNG, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints. 
 Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2023, lower commodity prices negatively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 135 million BOE, and positively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects, resulting in a proved reserves increase of approximately 89 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 31 percent and 35 percent. 
 Proved Reserve Quantities For the three years ended December 31, 2023, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company s control, such as delays in government

permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts. 
 At December 31, 2023, proved reserves for the company were 11 billion BOE. The company s estimated net proved reserves of liquids, including crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023, are shown in the table on page 110. The company s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 111, and the company s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 112. 
 
 Noteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2021 through 2023 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page: 
 Revisions In 2021, the 206 million barrels increase in United States was primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the Midland and Delaware basins. The higher commodity price environment led to the increase of 126 million barrels in the Gulf of Mexico primarily from Anchor and a 68 million barrels increase in the Midland and Delaware basins due to higher planned development activity. In TCO, entitlement effects and technical changes in field operating assumptions, reservoir model, and project schedule were primarily responsible for the 208 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan. Entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 106 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In the Other Americas, performance revisions and price effects, mainly in Canada and Argentina, were primarily responsible for the 41 million barrels increase. 
 In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan. 
 In 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities led to a decrease of 58 million barrels in California. In Other Americas, entitlement effects primarily contributed to an increase of 42 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone of Saudi Arabia/Kuwait, was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.

 Revisions In 2021, the approval of the Jansz Io Compression project was mainly responsible for the 1.2 trillion cubic feet (TCF) increase in Australia. Higher commodity prices, resulting in the increase of planned development activity in the Midland and Delaware basins, were mainly responsible for the 829 billion cubic feet (BCF) increase in the United States. In TCO, entitlement effects and technical changes in field operating assumptions, reservoir model, and project schedule were primarily responsible for the 179 BCF decrease. 
 In 2022, the performance of the Leviathan and Tamar fields in Israel and the Bibiyana and Jalalabad fields in Bangladesh were mainly responsible for the 1.8 TCF increase in Asia. In Australia, the 377 BCF decrease was mainly due to updated reservoir characterization of the Wheatstone field. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 285 BCF decrease. 
 In 2023, portfolio optimization decrease of 276 BCF and a reservoir performance decrease of 186 BCF in the Midland and Delaware basins along with a reduction in planned development activities leading to a decrease of 485 BCF in the Haynesville shale formation of east Texas, were mainly responsible for the 1.2 TCF decrease in the United States. In Asia, final investment decision on a new gas pipeline project in Israel and reservoir performance in Bangladesh were mainly responsible for the 481 BCF increase.

Table VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves 
 The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements. This includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition to those future wells and facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent management s estimate of the company s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.

This policy also applies to (1) any entities employees or their family members control, such as partnerships, trusts and corporations, and (2) brokerage accounts maintained for the benefit of employees or their family members if anyone has discretion over the accounts. Employees are responsible for the transactions of these other individuals and entities and therefore should make them aware of the need to confer with the employee before they transact in Chevron securities. 
 Ultimately, employees must avoid situations where their actions could reasonably lead one to believe that they are using material, non-public information for their own personal profit or that of their family members, friends, or other persons or entities whether or not this is the case. 
 Material information is information that a reasonable investor would consider important when deciding to buy, sell or hold a company s securities and or information that could affect a company s financial condition or stock price. Both positive and negative information can be material. Common examples of information that may be material include 
 Projections of earnings or operational results, changes in such projections, or other financial guidance 
 Actual earnings or operational results, including profits or operational results by asset, business unit, or geographic region or financial restatements 
 Significant pending or prospective mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, or other changes in company assets 
 Significant management changes or changes in control of Chevron 
 Updates regarding production and or reserves 
 Updates regarding new assets, discoveries or exploration results 

Major Capital Project milestones, work programs and project status 
 Capital expenditure and or operating costs or plans, or significant changes to these expected costs or plans 
 A significant increase or decline in an important line of business or important new product lines, licenses or patents 
 A significant new business or strategic relationship or a significant change in, or the loss of, such a relationship 
 Beginning of, or developments in, major litigation, government or other investigations (including without limitation those related to significant operational incidents), or regulatory actions or proceedings 
 Assessments of a potentially significant data loss or other major cybersecurity breach or incident 
 Significant asset impairments 
 Dividend payments, dividend increases or decreases, a change in dividend policy, the declaration of a stock split, or a private or public offering of additional debt or equity securities (but not simply rollovers or replacements of existing debt on expected terms) 
 Implementation, increase, decrease or cessation of share buyback programs 
 Deterioration or improvement in Chevron s credit status with rating agencies or the existence of liquidity problems 
 Change in auditors and agreements disagreements with auditors 
 The foregoing are merely examples and should not be treated as an all-inclusive list. Depending on the circumstances, information about other events or about other possible changes or developments not listed above may also be regarded as material. If in doubt, employees should err on the side of caution and not engage in the transaction without first seeking legal guidance. 
 Material information is non-public until it has been disclosed broadly to the marketplace and the investing public has had time to absorb and evaluate the information. Employees must safeguard material, non-public information from unauthorized use or disclosure prior to the release of the information to the public through appropriate channels, such as in an SEC filing (e.g., on a Form 10-Q, Form 10-K or Form 8-K), on the quarterly earnings call or in a press release. Typically, drafts of documents containing material information are distributed internally for review before their release to the public. Employees are prohibited from trading in stock on the basis of this information. Employees who are aware of this information should circulate this information on a need to know basis only. Any other circulation or sharing of information in these documents is prohibited. 
 Employees are required to understand their Policy 20 Insider Trading responsibilities. Employees who have been notified that they must comply with certain trading window or blackout periods are subject to additional timing restrictions on trading in Chevron 

securities. In general, employees who are aware of material, non-public information may not complete a securities transaction until the first business day that is at least 24 hours after the time that the material, non-public information is publicly released. Further, employees who must comply with certain trading window or blackout periods under Policy 20 must cancel any Good Til Cancelled orders during the periods in which trading is prohibited. 
 For purposes of clarity, with respect to the following Chevron plans, employees are restricted from trading in Chevron securities when they are aware of material, non-public information, or when they are subject to a Trading Window Period or trading blackout period as described in Policy 20, in the following instances 
 Stock Option Exercises (1) the sale of shares as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option and (2) any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price or tax withholding related to an option, as well as to the sale of the stock underlying the option. This restriction does not prohibit (a) the exercise of a stock option if employees pay the exercise price and tax withholding in cash and hold the underlying shares (b) the withholding of shares by Chevron to satisfy tax withholding requirements or (c) the receipt or vesting of stock options. 
 Restricted Stock Units the sale of any shares underlying restricted share units awarded to employees. This restriction does not prohibit (1) the receipt or vesting of restricted stock units or (2) the withholding of shares by Chevron to satisfy tax withholding requirements. 
 Deferred Compensation Plan (1) the selection of the Chevron stock fund as an investment election (2) an increase or decrease of the percentage of an employee s periodic contributions to the Chevron stock fund and (3) an intra-plan transfer of an existing account balance into or out of the Chevron stock account. 
 ESIP and ESIP-RP (1) the selection of the Chevron stock fund as an investment election (2) an increase or decrease of the percentage of an employee s periodic contributions to the Chevron stock fund (3) an intra-plan transfer of an existing account balance into or out of the Chevron stock fund (4) an election to borrow money against or withdraw funds from an employee s ESIP or ESIP-RP account if the loan or withdrawal will result in a liquidation of some or all of the employee s Chevron stock fund and (5) an election to prepay a plan loan if the prepayment will result in a change in an employee s Chevron stock fund balance. 
 With respect to the Deferred Compensation Plan, ESIP and ESIP-RP, this restriction does not prohibit continuing transactions in the Chevron stock fund that occur under an investment election that an employee made when the employee was not aware of material, non-public information or subject to a Trading Window Period or trading blackout period. 
 Insider trading is a crime. Violation of insider trading laws may subject individuals to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment. No violation is too small. 

Your fellow employees and Chevron itself may also be subject to such penalties, even if they did not authorize or condone the wrongdoing. Violation of Policy 20 will also lead to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

Document 

Exhibit 97.1 
 
 This Dodd-Frank Clawback Policy was approved by the Chevron Corporation Board of Directors on July 25, 2023. 

CHEVRON CORPORATION DODD-FRANK CLAWBACK POLICY 

PURPOSE 
 
 This Policy of Chevron Corporation Chevron is intended to comply with, and as applicable to be administered and interpreted consistent with, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and Section 303A.14 of the New York Stock Exchange NYSE Listed Company Manual (collectively, the Listing Standards ). 
 
 Each Covered Executive shall be required to sign and return to Chevron the Acknowledgement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A pursuant to which such Covered Executive will agree to be bound by the terms and comply with this Policy. 
 
 DEFINITIONS 
 
 As used in this Policy, the following definitions shall apply. 
 
 1. Accounting Restatement shall mean any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 
 
 2. Covered Executive means Chevron s executive officers as defined in the Listing Standards. 
 
 3. Effective Date is October 2, 2023. 
 
 4. Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall mean, with respect to each Covered Executive in connection with an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation Received that exceeds the amount that otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated financial statements, computed without regard to any taxes paid. 
 5. A Financial Reporting Measure means any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing Chevron s financial statements, and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure provided, however, that a Financial Reporting Measure is not required to be presented within Chevron s financial statements or included in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to qualify as a Financial Reporting Measure. For purposes of this Policy, Financial Reporting Measure also includes, but is not limited to, stock price and total stockholder return. 

6. Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation granted, earned or vested based in whole or in part on Chevron s attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure that was Received by a person (i) on or after the Effective Date and after the person began service as a Covered Executive, and (ii) who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for the Incentive Based Compensation. Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed to be Received in the fiscal period during which the relevant financial reporting measure is attained, regardless of when the compensation is actually paid or awarded. 
 7. Recovery Period means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that Chevron is required to prepare the Accounting Restatement, as well as any transition period as prescribed under the Listing Standards. 
 
 8. Restatement Date shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) the date Chevron s Board of Directors (the Board ), a committee of the Board or the officers of Chevron authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the issuer is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (ii) the date of court, regulatory or other legally authorized body directs the issuer to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 
 
 RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION 
 
 It is the policy of Chevron that, in the event Chevron is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement of Chevron s financial statements, Chevron will recover on a reasonably prompt basis the amount of any Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a Covered Executive during the Recovery Period that exceeds the amount that otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated financial statements. 
 Chevron need not recover the excess amount of Incentive-Based Compensation if and to the extent that the Management Compensation Committee of the Board (the Committee determines that such recovery is impracticable and not required under the Listing Standards, including if the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable due to the following 
 
 1. The direct expense paid to a third party to assist with enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered after making a reasonable attempt to recover such amounts, documenting such attempts and providing such documentation to the NYSE 
 
 2. Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, provided that, before determining that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, Chevron has obtained an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the NYSE, that recovery would result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to the NYSE or 

3. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of Chevron, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 
 
 INDEMNIFICATION PROHIBITION 
 
 Chevron shall not be permitted to indemnify any Covered Executive against (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid, returned, or recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to Chevron s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. Further, Chevron shall not be permitted to enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive- based Compensation from the application of this Policy or that waives Chevron s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on, or after the Effective Date). 
 
 ADMINISTRATION INTERPRETATION 
 
 This Policy is administered by the Committee. Any determinations made by the Committee, including without limitation the amount to be recovered, shall be final and binding on all affected individuals. The Committee is authorized to take appropriate steps to implement this Policy with respect to Incentive-Based Compensation arrangements with Covered Executives. 
 
 AMENDMENT TERMINATION 
 
 The Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary, including as and when it determines that it is legally required by any federal securities laws, SEC rule, or the rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on which Chevron s securities are listed. The Committee may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything in this provision to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by Chevron contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause Chevron to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule, or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which Chevron s securities are listed. 
 
 OTHER RECOUPMENT RIGHTS 
 The Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Committee may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or any other agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to Chevron under applicable law, regulation, or rule, or pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, individual retention agreement, equity award agreement, or plan or award terms, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to Chevron. 

SUCCESSORS 
 
 This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal representatives. 
 
 CHOICE OF LAW 
 
 This Policy and all rights and obligations hereunder are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, but without regard to its conflict of law rules. 
 
 SEVERABILITY 
 
 The provisions in this Policy shall be deemed severable and the validity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

 DEFINITIONS OF SELECTED ENERGY TERMS 
 
 Acreage 
 Land leased for oil and gas exploration and production. 
 
 Additives 
 Specialty chemicals incorporated into fuels and lubricants that enhance the performance of the finished product. 
 
 Barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE) 
 A unit of measure to quantify crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas amounts using the same basis. Natural gas volumes are converted to barrels on the basis of energy content. See oil-equivalent gas and production . 
 
 Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) 
 The process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions and either using them as a feedstock (utilization) or permanently storing them in geological formations deep underground (storage). 
 
 Carbon efficiency 
 The extent to which a given level of output is produced with fewer carbon emissions relative to average output. 
 
 Carbon intensity 
 The amount of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO 2 e) per unit of measure. 
 
 Condensate 
 Hydrocarbons that are in a gaseous state at reservoir conditions, but when produced are in liquid state at surface conditions. 
 
 Development 
 Drilling, construction and related activities following discovery that are necessary to begin production and transportation of crude oil and or natural gas. 
 
 Entitlement effects 
 The impact on Chevron s share of net production and net proved reserves due to changes in crude oil and natural gas prices, and spending levels, between periods. Under PSCs and variable-royalty provisions of certain agreements, price and spend variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and or volumes attributable to the company. For example, at higher prices, fewer volumes are required for Chevron to recover its costs under certain PSCs. Also under certain PSCs, Chevron s share of future profit oil and or gas is reduced once specified contractual thresholds are met, such as a cumulative return on investment. 
 
 Exploration 
 Searching for crude oil and or natural gas by utilizing geologic and topographical studies, geophysical and seismic surveys, and drilling of wells. 
 
 Gas-to-liquids (GTL) 
 A process that converts natural gas into high-quality liquid transportation fuels and other products. 
 
 Hydrogen 
 Includes lower carbon intensity hydrogen from specified hydrogen production pathways like steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage and electrolysis with lower carbon power. 
 
 Liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
 Natural gas that is liquefied under extremely cold temperatures to facilitate storage or transportation in specially designed vessels. 
 
 Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) 
 Light gases, such as butane and propane, that can be maintained as liquids while under pressure. 

E-7 

Lower carbon 
 A term describing environments, technologies, business sectors, markets, energy sources and mixes of energy sources, among other things, characterized by or enabling the reduction of carbon emissions or carbon intensities. 
 
 Lower carbon energy 
 Energy sources and mixes of energy sources that, in their production and use, emit less carbon emissions or have lower carbon intensity than other forms. 
 
 Lower carbon intensity oil, products and natural gas 
 Oil, natural gas and hydrocarbon-based products that are produced and sold to customers with a carbon intensity below that of traditional oil, natural gas and hydrocarbon-based products. 
 
 Natural gas liquids (NGLs) 
 Separated from natural gas, these include ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline. 
 
 Net reserves and resources 
 Chevron's interest share of oil and gas after removing royalty share and overriding royalties paid to others. Net includes any applicable Chevron-owned overriding royalties. 
 
 Net zero upstream aspiration (Scope 1 and 2) 
 Chevron aspires to reach net zero upstream emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2050. Accomplishing this aspiration depends on (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources (2) the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities (3) the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards (5) evolving regulatory requirements, including changes to IPCC s Global Warming Potentials, affecting ESG standards or disclosures (6) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals (7) customers and consumers preferences and use of the company s products or substitute products and (8) actions taken by the company s competitors in response to legislation and regulations. 
 
 Oil-equivalent gas (OEG) 
 The volume of natural gas needed to generate the equivalent amount of heat as a barrel of crude oil. Approximately 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to one barrel of crude oil. 
 
 Oil sands 
 Naturally occurring mixture of bitumen a heavy, viscous form of crude oil), water, sand and clay. Using hydroprocessing technology, bitumen can be refined to yield synthetic oil. 
 
 Petrochemicals 
 Compounds derived from petroleum. These include aromatics, which are used to make plastics, adhesives, synthetic fibers and household detergents and olefins, which are used to make packaging, plastic pipes, tires, batteries, household detergents and synthetic motor oils. 
 
 Portfolio Carbon Intensity (PCI) 
 Representation of the estimated energy-weighted average greenhouse gas emissions intensity from a simplified value chain from the production, refinement, distribution and end use of marketed energy products per unit of energy delivered. 
 
 Production 
 Total production refers to all the crude oil (including synthetic oil), natural gas liquids and natural gas produced from a property. Net production is the company's share of total production after deducting both royalties paid to landowners and a government s agreed-upon share of production under a production-sharing contract . Liquids production refers to crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil volumes. Oil-equivalent production is the sum of the barrels of liquids and the oil-equivalent barrels of natural gas produced. See barrels of oil-equivalent, oil-equivalent gas and production-sharing contract. 
 
 Production-sharing contract (PSC) 
 An agreement between a government and a contractor (generally an oil and gas company) whereby production is shared between the parties in a prearranged manner. The contractor typically incurs all exploration, development and production costs, which are subsequently recoverable out of an agreed-upon share of any future PSC production, referred to as cost 
 
 E-8 

recovery oil and or gas. Any remaining production, referred to as profit oil and or gas, is shared between the parties on an agreed-upon basis as stipulated in the PSC. The government may also retain a share of PSC production as a royalty payment, and the contractor typically owes income tax on its portion of the profit oil or gas. The contractor s share of PSC oil and or gas production and reserves varies over time, as it is dependent on prices, costs and specific PSC terms. 
 
 Refinery crude unit distillation utilization 
 Average feedstocks consumed in the crude unit in refineries for the year, expressed as a percentage of the refineries average annual crude unit capacity. 
 
 Reserves 
 Crude oil or natural gas contained in underground rock formations called reservoirs and saleable hydrocarbons extracted from oil sands, shale, coalbeds or other nonrenewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas. Net proved reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations and exclude royalties and interests owned by others. Estimates change as additional information becomes available. Oil-equivalent reserves are the sum of the liquids reserves and the oil-equivalent gas reserves. See barrels of oil-equivalent and oil-equivalent gas. The company discloses only net proved reserves in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 Resources 
 Estimated quantities of oil and gas resources are recorded under Chevron s 6P system, which is modeled after the Society of Petroleum Engineers Petroleum Resources Management System, and include quantities classified as proved, probable and possible reserves, plus those that remain contingent on commerciality. Unrisked resources, unrisked resource base and similar terms represent the arithmetic sum of the amounts recorded under each of these classifications. Recoverable resources, potentially recoverable volumes and other similar terms represent estimated remaining quantities that are forecast to be ultimately recoverable and produced in the future, adjusted to reflect the relative uncertainty represented by the various classifications. These estimates may change significantly as development work provides additional information. All of these measures are considered by management in making capital investment and operating decisions and may provide some indication to stockholders of the resource potential of oil and gas properties in which the company has an interest. 
 
 Shale gas 
 Natural gas produced from shale rock formations where the gas was sourced from within the shale itself. Shale is very fine-grained rock, characterized by low porosity and extremely low permeability. Production of shale gas normally requires formation stimulation such as the use of hydraulic fracturing (pumping a fluid-sand mixture into the formation under high pressure) to help produce the gas. 
 
 Synthetic oil 
 A marketable and transportable hydrocarbon liquid, resembling crude oil, that is produced by upgrading highly viscous or solid hydrocarbons, such as extra-heavy crude oil or oil sands . 
 
 Tight oil 
 Liquid hydrocarbons produced from shale (also referred to as shale oil and other rock formations with extremely low permeability. As with shale gas , production from tight oil reservoirs normally requires formation stimulation such as hydraulic fracturing . 
 
 Unconventional oil and gas resources 
 Hydrocarbons contained in formations over very large areas with extremely low permeability that are not influenced by buoyancy. In contrast, conventional resources are contained within geologic structures stratigraphy and float buoyantly over water. Unconventional resources include shale gas, coalbed methane, crude oil and natural gas from tight rock formations, tar sands, kerogen from oil shale, and gas hydrates that cannot commercially flow without well stimulation. 
 
 Wells 
 Oil and gas wells are classified as either exploration or development wells. Exploration wells are wells drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil and gas in another reservoir. Appraisal wells are exploration wells drilled to confirm the results of a discovery well. Delineation wells are exploration wells drilled to determine the boundaries of a productive formation or to delineate the extent of a find. Development wells are wells drilled in an existing reservoir in a proved oil- or gas-producing area. Completed wells are wells for which 
 
 E-9 

drilling work has been completed and that are capable of producing. Dry wells are wells completed as dry holes, that is, wells not capable of producing in commercial quantities.
