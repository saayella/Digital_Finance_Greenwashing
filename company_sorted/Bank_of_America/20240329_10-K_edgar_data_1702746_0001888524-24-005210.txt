EXPLANATORY NOTES 

The
MSBAM 2017-C33 mortgage pool includes the following mortgage loans, each of
which is serviced pursuant to a separate pooling and servicing agreement (each,
an Outside Pooling and Servicing Agreement ): 

the Pentagon Center
mortgage loan, which is serviced pursuant to the GSMS 2017-GS6 pooling and
servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 4.4; 

the Key Center
Cleveland mortgage loan, which is serviced pursuant to the CGCMT 2017-P7
pooling and servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2; 

the D.C. Office
Portfolio mortgage loan and the Ralph's Food Warehouse Portfolio mortgage loan,
which are serviced pursuant to the BANK 2017-BNK4 pooling and servicing
agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3; and 

the Gateway
Crossing mortgage loan, which is serviced pursuant to the MSC 2017-H1 pooling
and servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 4.5. 

Except
as set forth below, each of the parties to each pooling and servicing agreement
listed in the Exhibit Index both (1) participates in the servicing function for
purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB and (2) constitutes a servicer that meets
the criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Regulation AB for purposes
of Item 1123 of Regulation AB: 

The trustee under
a pooling and servicing agreement has a nominal role with respect to the
mortgage pool securitized pursuant to such pooling and servicing
agreement. The trustee s only servicing function is the contingent
obligation to make certain advances if the master servicer under such pooling
and servicing agreement fails to do so, while all other servicing functions are
performed by other parties. The trustee under each of the pooling and
servicing agreements listed in the Exhibit Index has confirmed to the
registrant that it has not made any such contingent advances during the
reporting period, and consequently, each such trustee does not participate in
the servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, nor does it
perform the functions of a servicer for purposes of the definition of
 servicer under Item 1101 of Regulation AB or for purposes of Item 1123 of
Regulation AB. 

The certificate
administrator under a pooling and servicing agreement performs various payment
administration functions solely for the securitization governed by such pooling
and servicing agreement and the mortgage pool securitized pursuant to such
pooling and servicing agreement and does not have any obligations with respect
to any other transaction. Consequently, the certificate administrator
under an Outside Pooling and Servicing Agreement does not participate in the
servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, nor does it
perform the functions of a servicer for purposes of the definition of
 servicer under Item 1101 of Regulation AB or for purposes of Item 1123 of
Regulation AB. 

The operating
advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement represents the interests of
senior certificateholders in the transaction governed by such pooling and
servicing agreement and is responsible for monitoring the performance of the
special servicer under such pooling and servicing agreement and producing
certain reports to certificateholders relating to the resolution of the
mortgage pool securitized pursuant to such pooling and servicing
agreement. The operating advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement
does not have any obligations with respect to any other transaction and is
solely obligated to perform loan reporting functions with respect to the
securitization governed by such pooling and servicing agreement. 
Consequently, the operating advisor under an Outside Pooling and Servicing
Agreement neither participates in the servicing function for purposes of Item
1122 of Regulation AB nor performs the functions of a servicer for purposes of
the definition of servicer under Item 1101 of Regulation AB or for purposes
of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. In addition, while the operating advisor
under a pooling and servicing agreement has certain reporting obligations in
respect of the related mortgage pool, it has no obligation to collect or
disburse funds in respect of the mortgage pool or to administer any of the
underlying mortgage loans. Consequently, the operating advisor under a
pooling and servicing agreement participates in the servicing function for
purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, but is not responsible for the management
or collection of the pool assets or making allocations or distributions to
holders of the asset-backed securities within the meaning of servicer under
Item 1101 of Regulation AB and does not perform the functions of a servicer for
purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. 

The asset
representations reviewer under a pooling and servicing agreement has a limited
obligation to review certain delinquent mortgage loans after a specified
delinquency threshold has been met and the required percentage of certificateholders
vote to direct a review of such delinquent mortgage loans, and has no
obligation to collect or disburse funds in respect of the mortgage pool, to
administer any of the underlying mortgage loans or to perform any servicing
function. Consequently, the asset representations reviewer under a
pooling and servicing agreement does not participate in the servicing function
for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, is not responsible for the
 management or collection of the pool assets or making allocations or
distributions to holders of the asset-backed securities within the meaning of
 servicer under Item 1101 of Regulation AB and does not perform the functions
of a servicer for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. 

Deutsche Bank
Trust Company Americas, is the custodian under the CGCMT 2017-P7 pooling and
servicing agreement, pursuant to which the Key Center Cleveland mortgage loan
is serviced. Because Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is not the
MSBAM 2017-C33 custodian, is not affiliated with any sponsor and services only
the Key Center Cleveland mortgage loan, which constitutes more than 5 but less
than 10 of the mortgage pool, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as CGCMT
2017-P7 custodian, constitutes a reporting servicing function participant for
purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, as specified in the Instruction 3 to
Item 1122, but does not constitute a reporting servicer for purposes of Item
1123 of Regulation AB, as specified in the Instruction to Item 1123. 

 Argentic
Services Company LP is the current special servicer under the MSC 2017-H1
pooling and servicing agreement, pursuant to which the Gateway Crossing
mortgage loan is serviced. On May 6, 2020, LNR Partners, LLC was replaced as
special servicer under the MSC 2017-H1 pooling and servicing agreement (other
than with respect to the One Presidential mortgage loan included in the MSC
2017-H1 mortgage pool) and succeeded by Argentic Services Company LP. On June
24, 2022, LNR Partners, LLC was replaced as special servicer under the MSC
2017-H1 pooling and servicing agreement with respect to the One Presidential
mortgage loan and succeeded by Argentic Services Company LP. Because Argentic
Services Company LP is not the MSBAM 2017-C33 special servicer, is not affiliated
with any sponsor and services only the Gateway Crossing mortgage loan, which
constitutes less than 5 of the mortgage pool, Argentic Services Company LP, as
MSC 2017-H1 special servicer, does not constitute a reporting servicing
function participant for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, as specified
in the Instruction 3 to Item 1122, and does not constitute a reporting
 servicer for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB, as specified in the
Instruction to Item 1123. 

 K-Star
Asset Management LLC is the current special servicer under the GSMS 2017-GS6
pooling and servicing agreement pursuant to which the Pentagon Center mortgage
loan is serviced. On May 2, 2023, Midland Loan Services, a Division of
PNC Bank, National Association was replaced as special servicer under the GSMS
2017-GS6 pooling and servicing agreement and succeeded by K-Star Asset
Management LLC. Because K-Star Asset Management LLC is not the MSBAM 2017-C33
special servicer, is not affiliated with any sponsor and services only the Pentagon
Center mortgage loan, which constitutes more than 5 but less than 10 of the
mortgage pool, K-Star Asset Management LLC, as GSMS 2017-GS6 special servicer,
constitutes a reporting servicing function participant for purposes of Item
1122 of Regulation AB, as specified in the Instruction 3 to Item 1122, but does
not constitute a reporting servicer for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation
AB, as specified in the Instruction to Item 1123. 

In
addition, each of the following parties engaged the services of certain
servicing function participants and sub-servicers for the reporting period, as
set forth below: 

Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as master servicer, engaged the services of KeyBank
National Association, as a sub-servicer in respect of the entire mortgage pool
for the reporting period. 

Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as master servicer, engaged the services of (i) CoreLogic
Solutions, LLC as a servicing function participant in respect of the entire
mortgage pool for the reporting period, and (ii) Berkadia Commercial Mortgage
LLC as a servicing function participant in respect of 2.06 of the mortgage
pool for the reporting period. 

Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as master servicer under the CGCMT 2017-P7 pooling and
servicing agreement, pursuant to which the Key Center Cleveland mortgage loan
is serviced, engaged the services of CoreLogic Solutions, LLC and Berkadia
Commercial Mortgage LLC, in each case as a servicing function participant in
respect of the Key Center Cleveland mortgage loan for the reporting period. 

Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
as master servicer under the BANK 2017-BNK4 pooling and servicing agreement,
pursuant to which the D.C. Office Portfolio and Ralph s Food Warehouse
Portfolio mortgage loans are serviced, engaged the services of CoreLogic
Solutions, LLC as a servicing function participant in respect of the D.C.
Office Portfolio and Ralph s Food Warehouse Portfolio mortgage loans for the
reporting period. 

On November 1, 2021, pursuant to the
second amended and restated servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit
99.12, Computershare Trust Company, National Association was engaged to perform
all or virtually all of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association s roles as

In
December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related
entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its
capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities
(RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by
Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York, IKB International and IKB
Deutsche Industriebank (together, IKB) in New York state court, and Park Royal
I LLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state court. In each case, the
plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to
investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other
things, the trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase
obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations
and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by
appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. In July
2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light s claims and certain of the
claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each
case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and
Commerzbank AG each appealed the district court s decision to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Phoenix Light dismissed its appeal in
May 2023, terminating its case. In November 2023, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
entered into an agreement with IKB to resolve IKB s claims. Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and
an action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar
allegations. 

Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company DBNTC have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their role
as trustees of certain residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. 

On
June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by Blackrock
Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed an action against DBNTC
and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court alleging that DBNTC and DBTCA failed
to perform purported duties, as trustees for 544 private-label RMBS trusts, to
enforce breaches of representations and warranties as to mortgage loans held by
the trusts and to enforce breaches by servicers of their mortgage loan
servicing obligations for the trusts. During the course of the
litigation, plaintiffs dismissed the case from New York State Supreme Court and
refiled two separate cases, one in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York (the BlackRock SDNY Case and the other in the Superior
Court of California, Orange County (the BlackRock California Case ). 
Pursuant to a settlement among the parties, the BlackRock SDNY Case was
dismissed on December 6, 2018, and the BlackRock California Case was dismissed
on January 11, 2019. 

On
September 27, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by certain
special purpose entities including Phoenix Light SF Limited in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which the plaintiffs
previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 43 of the
trusts at issue. On September 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a third amended
complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA
serves as trustee for one of the 43 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee
for the other 42 trusts at issue. Plaintiffs third amended complaint
brings claims for violation of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 TIA 
breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence and gross negligence;
violation of New York s Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good
faith. However, in the third amended complaint, plaintiffs acknowledge
that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed plaintiffs TIA
Act claims, negligence and gross negligence claims, Streit Act claims, claims
for breach of the covenant of good faith, and certain theories of plaintiffs 
breach of contract claims, and plaintiffs only include these claims to preserve
any rights on appeal. Plaintiffs allege damages of hundreds of millions
of dollars. On November 13, 2017, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the
third amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a
motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, plaintiffs,
jointly with Commerzbank AG (see description of Commerzbank case below), filed
a motion for partial summary judgment. On October 27, 2021, DBNTC and
DBTCA filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment relating to plaintiffs 
standing. On February 8, 2022, the court issued an order in which it
granted DBNTC and DBTCA s supplemental motion for summary judgment, granted in
part DBNTC and DBTCA s initial motion for summary judgment, and denied
plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that
order, all of plaintiffs claims were dismissed with prejudice. On April 26,
2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the
court s summary judgment order. 

On
November 30, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by
Commerzbank AG Commerzbank in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York, in which Commerzbank previously alleged incorrectly that
DBNTC served as trustee for all 50 of the trusts at issue. On November
30, 2017, Commerzbank filed a second amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant
in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for 1 of the 50 trusts at
issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 49 trusts at issue. 
Commerzbank s second amended complaint brings claims for violation of the TIA;
breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence; violation of the
Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the
second amended complaint, Commerzbank acknowledges that, before DBTCA was added
to the case, the court dismissed Commerzbank s TIA claims for the trusts
governed by pooling and servicing agreements, as well as its Streit Act claims
and claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and Commerzbank only
includes these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. The second
amended complaint alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA caused Commerzbank to suffer
 hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, but the complaint does not include
a demand for money damages in a sum certain. On January 29, 2018, DBNTC
and DBTCA filed an answer to the second amended complaint. On December 7,
2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on
December 7, 2018, Commerzbank, jointly with the Phoenix Light plaintiffs, filed
a motion for partial summary judgment. On February 8, 2022, the court
issued an order in which it granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for
summary judgment and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary
judgment. As a result of that order, many of plaintiffs claims and
theories were dismissed with prejudice. Discovery is ongoing. 

On
December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche
Industriebank A.G. (collectively, IKB ), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts,
filed a summons with notice in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. On May
27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract,
breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest,
violation of the Streit Act, violation of the TIA, violation of Regulation AB,
and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. IKB alleges
that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over U.S. 268 million in damages. On
October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending
lawsuits by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss. On January 6, 2017 and
June 20, 2017, IKB voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims as to seven
trusts. On January 27, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part
DBNTC and DBTCA s motion to dismiss. The court granted the motion to
dismiss with respect to IKB s claims for violations of the Streit Act,
Regulation AB, and Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as certain
aspects of IKB s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and
violation of the TIA. The court denied the remainder of the motion to
dismiss. IKB s remaining claims for breach of contract, breach of
fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of
the TIA will proceed. On May 10, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a notice of
appeal with the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department,
regarding certain aspects of the court s order on the motion to dismiss. 
On May 20, 2021, IKB filed a notice of cross appeal with respect to other
aspects of that order. On August 30, 2022, the New York Supreme Court,
Appellate Division, First Department affirmed in part and reversed in part the
court s order on the motion to dismiss. After DBNTC and DBTCA appealed
the First Department s decision, on June 15, 2023, the New York Court of
Appeals reversed the First Department s decision in part, dismissing certain
additional contract claims, as well as IKB s claims for breach of fiduciary
duty and breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest. On June 2, 2021, IKB
filed a motion for re-argument regarding certain aspects of the court s order
on the motion to dismiss, which the court denied on August 3, 2021. On
May 13, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the complaint. On October
28, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with
prejudice all claims as to seven additional trusts. On December 29, 2021,
the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all
claims as to one additional trust. On April 22, 2022, the parties filed a
stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to 17
certificates at issue, including all claims as to 5 trusts. On February
28, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with
prejudice all claims as to two trusts, leaving 15 trusts at issue. On
November 21, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with
prejudice all claims as to three trusts, leaving 12 trusts at issue. 
Discovery is ongoing. 

It
is DBTCA s belief that it has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on
DBTCA s present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing
paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties
under the related servicing agreement.

The management Management of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association (the Company or Wells Fargo is responsible for
assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are
applicable in regard to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 

Sale
of Corporate Trust Services Business . 
On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold
substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. Computershare Trust Company ),
Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with Computershare Trust
Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells
Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices
transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. See Appendix B 
for more information regarding such transition as it relates to the CMBS
Platform (defined below). 

Period : As of and for the twelve months ended December
31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of commercial
mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of
commercial mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company was
appointed to perform trustee, securities administration, paying agent services,
and/or related services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued
securities for such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a
registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
or (b) the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered
pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation
under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with
the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, (i) the platform excludes any
transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government-sponsored entity, and (ii) the platform excludes any transactions
for which the offered securities were issued pursuant to a transaction that
closed prior to January 1, 2006 and for which the Company outsources all
material servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) to a party other
than Computershare Trust Company or any affiliate thereof (the CMBS
Platform ). As a result of Wells Fargo s sale of the CTS division to
Computershare, Wells Fargo has not accepted any appointments to perform
trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related
services on new CMBS transactions after November 1, 2021, other than a few
exceptions to facilitate the transition of the CTS business to Computershare.
 Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management
as constituting the CMBS Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Period : 
Management has determined that the following servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) are relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company
with respect to the CMBS Platform transactions for the Period: 
1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) from January 1, 2023
through December 31, 2023, and 1122(d)(2)(vi) from January 1, 2023 through
October 9, 2023 (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management
has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are
not applicable to the Company s servicing activities with respect to the CMBS
Platform for the Period.

Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the

compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In performing this
assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criterion 1122(d)(2)(iii), Management has determined that there were no
activities performed during the Period with respect to the CMBS Platform,
because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to
perform such activities.

 Certificates, Series 2014-LC14 

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its
roles on the CMBS Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As
of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo had not transferred to
Computershare the roles associated with its trustee, securities administration,
paying agent services, and/or related services, and the duties, rights, and
liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the CMBS
Platform transactions. During all or a portion of the Period, for all the
CMBS Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 
to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction
agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is
a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the CMBS
Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing
activities performed by Computershare for the CMBS Platform (the Computershare
Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is
taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s
compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the CMBS
Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

1 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare Corporate Trust-
CMBS Platform 

The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company,
National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management
has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing
platform for the period as follows: 

Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells
Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its
Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ).
Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS
systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. 

For the CMBS Platform (defined
below) transactions and during the Period (defined below), the Company either
(i) served directly in the related trustee, securities administration, paying
agent, and/or related roles (collectively, the CMBS Platform Roles ),
or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS
Platform Roles. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo
CTS business on November 1, 2021, including during the Period, the Company has (i)
closed new CMBS transactions and (ii) completed the transfer of certain CMBS
transaction roles from Wells Fargo CTS to Computershare, for which, in each
case, during all or a portion of the Period, the Company performed the related
CMBS Platform Roles directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). 
The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the
overall CMBS Platform transactions for the Period. For a significant majority
of CMBS Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the
Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform
Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). For the Company s
Agent Role Transactions, Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the
Period, transferred to Computershare the CMBS Platform Roles for the Company s
Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a
portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for
such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role
Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a
party participating in the servicing function with respect to the CMBS
Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing
its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant
to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the CMBS Platform, as
of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

Period : As
of January 1, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of commercial mortgage-backed
securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage
loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in
the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration
statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the
issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to
an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it
acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an
assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any
transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ). Appendix A 
identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting
the CMBS Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria : All servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to either the Company s obligations, or
the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in
either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS
Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ),
except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii),
1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not
applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the CMBS Platform for
the Period; provided however that, with respect to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing
criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations related
to the aggregation of information received and the conveyance of such
information, in each case, as required by the transaction agreements, and (b) servicing
criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations
related to the process of making or effecting an addition, removal or
substitution to the asset pool in accordance with the transaction agreements (the
 Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 

Third
parties classified as vendors : 
With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company engaged a vendor
to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing obligations required by the
servicing criterion. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for
transactions in the CMBS Platform, the Company engaged, at times during the
Period, one vendor, and at other times during the Period, two vendors, in each
case to make certain payments by check to investors and/or third parties, and
to safeguard certain unissued checks. In each case, Management has determined
that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to each vendor
as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has
policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that
the activities of each vendor comply in all material respects with the
servicing criterion applicable to each vendor. Management is solely
responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to
apply C DI 200.06 for each vendor and the related servicing criterion.

With respect to the CMBS
Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the
Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. 
 Management is responsible for
assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. 
 Management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing
criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 , as
described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria
set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item
1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), and 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has
determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with
respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that
would require the Company to perform such activities. 

4. 
 Based on such assessment for the
Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its
roles on the Document Custody Platform transactions to Computershare is
ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo had not
transferred to Computershare its document custody related roles, and the
duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements
for any of the Document Custody Platform transactions. During all or a
portion of the Period, for all the Document Custody Platform transactions,
Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform
virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements.
 As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party
participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody
Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing
activities performed by Computershare for the Document Custody Platform (the Computershare
Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is
taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing
Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023. 

1 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare Corporate Trust -
Document Custody Platform 

The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National
Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has
determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform
for the period as follows: 

Purchase of corporate trust
business . On November 1, 2021, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold
substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to
the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and
Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with
the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of
Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices
transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 

For the Document Custody
Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period (defined below),
the Company either (i) served directly in the related document custody services
role (collectively, the Document Custody Platform Role ), or (ii)
served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody
Platform Role. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS
business on November 1, 2021, including during the Period, the Company has (i) closed
new document custody transactions and (ii) completed the transfer of certain
document custody transaction roles from Wells Fargo CTS to Computershare, for
which, in each case, during all or a portion of the Period, the Company
performed the related Document Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s
Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions
comprise a minority of the overall Document Custody Platform transactions for
the Period. For a significant majority of the Document Custody Platform
transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as
agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform
Role (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). For the Company s Agent
Role Transactions, Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period,
transferred to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role, and therefore
the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of
Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a
result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo
have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing
function with respect to the Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the
Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing
activities performed by the Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of
and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

Period : As
of January 1, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed
securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company provides document custody
services , either directly in the related role for such
services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for
which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and
ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to
a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions
were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption
from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has
an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB;
provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the
offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity,
other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(the Document Custody Platform ). Appendix A identifies the
individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria : Management has determined
that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the Company s
obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately
acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with
respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s
Obligations provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform,
servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the
Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related
to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction
agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management has
determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not
applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the Document Custody Platform
for the Period. 

Third parties classified as
vendors : With respect to servicing
criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), for certain ABS transactions included
in the Document Custody Platform, the Company has engaged a vendor to handle
certain aspects of maintaining and safeguarding pool assets, the security
thereon, and related documents as required by such servicing criteria. 
Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii) applicable to this vendor as permitted by the
SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors
Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining
that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for
the vendor and the related servicing criteria. 

With respect to the Document
Custody Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment
of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. 
 Management is responsible for
assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. 
 Management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the
servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI
200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used
the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph
(d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no
activities performed during the Period with respect to the Document Custody
Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the
Company to perform such activities. 

4. 
 Based on such assessment for the Period,
the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Period.

2023 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable
Servicing Criteria 

Management of Wells Fargo Commercial
Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (the
 Company is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities
and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of commercial and multifamily
loans (the Platform ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii),
1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv),
which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it
performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December
31, 2023. Appendix A to this letter identifies the commercial mortgage and
multifamily pools and other structures involving the commercial and multifamily
loans constituting the Platform. Appendix B to this letter identifies the
applicable servicing criteria with respect to the Platform. 

With respect to servicing
criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company performs applicable
activities covered by these criteria, with respect to the Platform, except the
Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain tax payment activities. Such
vendor has provided a separate Regulation AB Item 1122 management assessment
and attestation for such activities. 

With respect to applicable
servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), there were no activities performed during
the year ended December 31, 2023, with respect to the Platform, because there
were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities. 

With respect to servicing
criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii),
the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by
these servicing criteria. The Company s management has determined that none of
these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and the Company s management has elected to take responsibility
for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor
as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06)
(formerly SEC Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations 17.06).
The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company s management is
solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria. 

The Company s management has
assessed the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Based on such assessment,
management believes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the
Company has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange
Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 

The Company has not identified
and is not aware of any material instance of noncompliance by the Vendors with
the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2023, or for the Reporting
Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

The Company has not identified
any material deficiency in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance
by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2023,
or for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

KPMG LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to
management s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

December 31, 2023 (the Reporting Period ). In making this assessment, Midland
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB. This report covers all transactions serviced
on the Enterprise! Loan Management System (the Platform during the
Reporting Period. 

Midland engaged certain
vendors, which are not servicers as defined in item 1101(j) of Regulation AB
(the Vendors ), to perform specific and limited or scripted activities related
to portions of the servicing criteria as set forth in Appendix A. Midland
elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing
criteria or portion of the servicing criteria applicable to such Vendors 
activities as set forth in Appendix A. Midland has not identified and is not
aware of any material instances of noncompliance by the Vendors with the
applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2023 and for the Reporting
Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole, nor has it identified any
material deficiencies in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance
by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2023
and for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

Based on this assessment,
Midland concludes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, Midland
has complied in all material respects with the applicable servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB.

MANAGEMENT'S
ASSERTION ON 

 COMPLIANCE WITH
REGULATION AB SERVICING CRITERIA 

KeyBank
National Association, as successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital
Markets, Inc. (the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing
compliance for the transactions listed on Appendix A for the period January 1,
2023 through December 31, 2023 (the Reporting Period ), with the
servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of
Federal Regulations (the CFR ), except for the servicing criteria
which the Asserting Party has concluded are not applicable, as indicated on
Appendix B attached hereto (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ), to
the servicing of the transactions listed on Appendix A, backed by commercial
real estate mortgage loans and serviced by the Asserting Party. Although the
Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance with Section 229.1122
(d)(l)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by
the Asserting Party during the year ended December 31, 2023, that required this
servicing criteria to be complied with. 

The
Asserting Party has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party has
complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria for
the transactions listed on Appendix A backed by commercial real estate mortgage
loans serviced by the Asserting Party. 

The
Asserting Party has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by the
servicing criteria as set forth in Appendix B. The Asserting Party has
determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined
in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Asserting Party has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section
200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06. As permitted
by C DI 200.06, the Asserting Party has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's
activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable
to the vendor. The Asserting Party is solely responsible for determining that
it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and
related criteria. 

Ernst
 Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

MANAGEMENT S
ASSERTION OF COMPLIANCE 

Management
of the Trust Agency Services department of Deutsche Bank National Trust Company
and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (collectively the Company is
responsible for assessing the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission to
determine which criteria are applicable to the Company in respect of the
servicing platform described below. Management has determined that the
servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and
for the period as follows: 

Platform : Publicly-issued i.e. ,
transaction-level reporting required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended) and certain privately-issued i.e. , for which
transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation)
residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities
and other asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006, for which
the Company provides trustee, certificate administrator, securities
administration, paying agent or custodian services, as defined in the
transaction agreements, excluding publicly-issued securities sponsored or
issued by any government sponsored entity (the Platform (see Appendix A). 

Applicable
Servicing Criteria :
All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d), to the extent required by
Item 1122(d) servicing criteria in regards to the activities performed by the
Company with respect to the Platform as to any transaction, except for the
following criteria: 1122(d)(4)(iv) 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which management has
determined are not applicable to the activities the Company performs with
respect to the Platform (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). With respect to
Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii)
and 1122(d)(4)(iii) there were no activities performed during the year ended
December 31, 2023 with respect to the Platform, because there were no
occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities. 

Period : Year ended
December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Management's
interpretation of Applicable Servicing Criteria : The Company s
management has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(iii) is
applicable only with respect to its continuing obligation to act as, or locate
a, successor servicer under the circumstances referred to in certain
transaction agreements. It is management's interpretation that the Company has
no other active back-up servicing responsibilities in regards to servicing
criterion 1122(d)(1)(iii) as of and for the Period. The Company s management has
determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the
activities the Company performs related to the mathematically accurate
aggregation of information received from servicers and the accurate conveyance
of such information within reports to investors. The Company s management has
determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable to the
activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform only as it relates
to the Company s obligation to report additions, removals or substitutions on
reports to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements. 

With
respect to the Platform as of and for the Period, the Company s management
provides the following assertion of compliance with respect to the Applicable
Servicing Criteria: 

The Company s management is
responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria. 

The Company s management has
assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

Based on such assessment, the
Company has complied, in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria. 

Ernst
 Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report with respect to management s assertion of compliance with
the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the Period.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The
Board of Directors 

 Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association: 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying ASSESSMENT OF
COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA, that the Corporate Trust
Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for commercial
mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial
mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company was appointed to perform
trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related services,
and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such CMBS
transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement
delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued
securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an
exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided
however that, (i) the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, and
(ii) the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities
were issued pursuant to a transaction that closed prior to January 1, 2006 and
for which the Company outsources all material servicing activities (as defined
by Regulation AB) to a party other than Computershare Trust Company or any
affiliate thereof (the CMBS Platform as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023. Appendix A to the ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE
APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA identifies the individual asset-backed transactions
and securities defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. 

The
Company s management has determined that the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv) and 1122(d)(2)(iii) are applicable to the
servicing activities performed by the Company with respect to the CMBS Platform
as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and servicing criterion
1122(d)(2)(vi) is applicable to the servicing activities performed by the
Company with respect to the CMBS Platform from January 1, 2023 through October
9, 2023 (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). With respect to
Applicable Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(2)(iii), Management has determined that
there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31,
2023 with respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of
events that would require the Company to perform such activities. The Company s
management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) are not applicable to the Company because the Company does not perform
activities with respect to the CMBS Platform relating to those servicing criteria.
Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation
standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test
basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed
transactions and securities that comprise the CMBS Platform, testing selected
servicing activities related to the CMBS Platform, and determining whether the
Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. Furthermore,
our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination
engagement. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects. 

We
do not express an opinion or any form of assurance on the statements in Appendix
B to the ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Audit Committee of
Computershare Trust Company, National Association 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate Trust - CMBS Platform 
that Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company complied
with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and
Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage-backed
securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans
and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in
the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration
statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the
issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to
an exemption from registration and either the Company (and/or the party for
whom it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to
deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform
excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued,
sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.
government or any government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ), as of December
31, 2023 and for the year then ended (the Period ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not
applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party
for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related
transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period (as
applicable, the Company s Obligations provided however that, with respect
to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only
to the Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received
and the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the
transaction agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is
applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the process of making
or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in
accordance with the transaction agreements. 

As described in management's
assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company
has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB,
and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB
and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation
200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted
that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Appendix A to management's
assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities
defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. 

The Company s management is
responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination
included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that
comprise the CMBS Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to
the CMBS Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected
transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect
noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent
to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe
that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be
independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with
the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December
31, 2023 for the CMBS Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA, that the Corporate Trust Services

The Company s

with respect to the Document Custody Platform as of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2023: Item 1122(d)(1)(ii) and 1122(d)(1)(iv) (the
 Applicable Servicing Criteria ). The Company s management has determined that
all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to
the Company because the Company does not perform activities with respect to the

responsible for the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion
about the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria based on

testing selected servicing activities related to the Document Custody Platform,
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions
and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by
this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may

compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

We are required to

In our opinion,
management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Audit Committee of
Computershare Trust Company, National Association 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate Trust - Document Custody
Platform that Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the
 Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the residential
mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed
securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company provides document custody
services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent
of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of
the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly
offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement
delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued
securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on
or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the
Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under
the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided
however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities
were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of
the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS
transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the Document Custody
Platform ), as of December 31, 2023 and for the year then ended (the Period ),
excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(i); 1122(d)(1)(iii); 1122(d)(1)(v);
1122(d)(2)(i-vii); 1122(d)(3)(i-iv); and 1122(d)(4)(iv-xv), which Management
has determined are not applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the
obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in
either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the Document
Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations 
provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform (a) servicing
criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s
Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any
additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction
agreements. 

As described in management's
assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), the Company
has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by these servicing
criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer 
as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to
take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure
Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s
interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by
Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the
vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no
procedures with respect to the Company's determination of its eligibility to
use Interpretation 200.06. 

Appendix A to management's
assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities
defined by management as constituting the Document Custody Platform. 

The Company s management is
responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination
included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that
comprise the Document Custody Platform, testing of selected servicing
activities related to the Document Custody Platform, and determining whether
the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that
may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected
the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the
evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable
basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be independent
and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant
ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with
the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December
31, 2023 for the Document Custody Platform is fairly stated, in all material
respects.

The
Board of Directors 

 Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association: 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying 2023
Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that
Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB
(the Servicing Criteria) for Commercial and Multifamily Loans (the Platform),
except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D),
1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has
determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the
Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company has
determined that servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii) are
applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform,
except for certain tax payment activities that the Company has engaged various
vendors to perform. With respect to applicable servicing criterion
1122(d)(4)(iii), the Company has determined that there were no activities
performed during the year ended December 31, 2023 with respect to the Platform
because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to
perform such activities. Appendix A to the 2023 Certification Regarding
Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual
asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting
the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the
Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on
our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the
Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected
asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing
selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether
the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the Servicing Criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination
engagement. 

As
described in the accompanying 2023 Certification Regarding Compliance with
Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i),
1122(d)(4)(vi), and for certain activities related to 1122(d)(4)(xi), and
1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the
activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined
that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility
for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor
as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation
(C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As
permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors 
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and
related servicing criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no
procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage
Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, complied with
the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii) for which
compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the
Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed

its assertion and for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on
our examination. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i),
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi),
1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged
certain vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria.
The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered servicers as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06
of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules
adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company
has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material
respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is
solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all
material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed
transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected
servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the
Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures
were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by
the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts

We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Midland complied with the
aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors and
Shareholder 

 KeyBank National Association 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion on Compliance
with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that KeyBank National Association, as
successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc., (the Company)
complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for commercial real estate
mortgage loans platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, except
for Item 1122 (d)(3)(i)(b), 1122 (d)(3)(i)(c), 1122 (d)(3)(i)(d), 1122
(d)(3)(ii), 1122 (d)(3)(iii) and 1122 (d)(3)(iv), which the Company has determined
are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the
servicing platform covered by this report as noted in Appendix B of
management s assertion. See Appendix A of management s assertion for the asset
backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the
Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the
individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria
and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of
the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the
selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during
the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to
determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our
tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by
the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected
transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for
assessing compliance with Item 1122 (d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no
servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December
31, 2023 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe
that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We are required to be
independent of Key Bank National Association and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related
to our examination engagement. 

Our examination does not
provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria. 

As described in management s
assertion, for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi), the Company has engaged a
vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing criteria. The
Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by
C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures
in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities
comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the
vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as
described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the
Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In our opinion, the Company complied
with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122
(d)(4)(xi) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as
described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Management of CoreLogic Solutions, LLC: 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s
Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria,
that CoreLogic Solutions, LLC. (the Company complied with the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage loan outsourcing
customers for which the Company served as the tax service provider (the
 Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 excluding criteria
1122(d)(1)(i iii), 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(2)(iii iv),
1122(d)(3)(i iv), 1122(d)(4)(i x), and 1122(d)(4)(xii xv), which management has
determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with
respect to the Platform. The Platform consists of the transactions performed
for commercial mortgage loan outsourcing customers for which the Company served
as the tax service provider. Management is responsible for the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform based on our
examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the
Platform and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed
transactions and securities constituting the Platform and evaluating whether
the Company performed servicing activities related to those transactions and
securities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the period
covered by this report. Accordingly, our testing may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction or security
constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was not designed to detect
material noncompliance that may have occurred prior to the period covered by
this report and that may have affected the Company s servicing activities
during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that CoreLogic Solutions, LLC complied with
the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2023 for the commercial mortgage loan outsourcing customers for
which the Company served as the tax service provider is fairly stated, in all
material respects.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Board
of Directors 

 Berkadia
Commercial Mortgage, LLC 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s
Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria Management s Report ), that Berkadia Commercial Mortgage, LLC (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the Primary Servicing of
Commercial Mortgage Loans within Public Securitizations (the Primary Servicing
Platform or the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023,
excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(vii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which management has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the
Platform. The Platform consists of the of the publicly issues asset-backed
transactions and securities for which the Company is named the master servicer
of commercial mortgage loans. Management is responsible for the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the
Platform and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed
transactions and securities constituting the Platform and evaluating whether
the Company performed servicing activities related to those transactions and
securities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the period
covered by this report. Accordingly, our testing may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction or security
constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was not designed to detect
material noncompliance that may have occurred prior to the period covered by
this report and that may have affected the Company s servicing activities
during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 

As
described in Management s Report, the Company engaged various vendors to
perform servicing activities with respect to criteria 1122(d)(2)(i),
1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i), and 1122(d)(4)(xi) through 1122(d)(4)(xiii).
The Company determined that each vendor is not considered a servicer, as that
term is defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and therefore, the Company is
assuming responsibility for compliance with such servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor s servicing activities. In accordance with Regulation AB and its
related interpretations, the requirement for management to assess compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to a vendor s activities is satisfied if
the Company has instituted policies and procedures to monitor whether such
vendor s activities comply in all material respects with such criteria. Compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria is achieved if those policies and
procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such vendor s activities
comply with such criteria and those policies and procedures are operating
effectively for the period covered by Management s Report. Our examination does
not provide a legal determination of whether a vendor is or is not considered a
servicer, and therefore, on whether the Company, in its Management Report, is
eligible to elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s servicing activities. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC
complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Primary Servicing Platform is fairly
stated, in all material respects.

of K-Star Asset Management LLC 

We
have examined management of K-Star Asset Management LLC s (the Company assertion that the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for all
transactions for which the Company acted as special servicer (the Platform ),
excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(ii),

responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the
Company s compliance with the specified requirements based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation
standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the specified requirements is fairly stated, in all material
respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence
about whether management s assertion is fairly stated, in all material
respects. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on
our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
management s assertion, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the
evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the specified requirements. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned applicable servicing criteria included in the accompanying
Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with Securities and Exchange

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Rialto
Capital Advisors, LLC: 

We
have examined management of Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC s assertion, included
in the accompanying Management s Assertions on Compliance with Applicable
Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC (the
 Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial
mortgage loan platform (the Platform ), excluding criteria in Items 1122
(d)(1)(iii), (d)(3)(i.C), (d)(3)(i.D), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), (d)(3)(iv),
(d)(4)(v), (d)(4)(ix), (d)(4)(x), (d)(4)(xii), (d)(4)(xiii), (d)(4)(xiv), and
(d)(4)(xv) (the servicing criteria ), as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023, which management has determined are not applicable to the activities
performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Exhibit 1 to
management s assertion identifies the individual asset backed transactions
defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria and its assertion. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the
Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material
respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a
sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the
servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were
limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset backed transaction included in the
Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance
arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above
that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the
Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence
we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria Item
1122(d)(1)(ii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities
required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these
vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted
by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors
Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06,
the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all
material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors. The
Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for these vendors and related criteria as
described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the
Company s determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023, for the commercial mortgage loan platform, is fairly stated, in all
material respects.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Deutsche
Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s
Assertion of Compliance, that Trust Agency Services department of
Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas
(collectively the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the
publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting required under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued
(i.e., for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to
contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial
mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities issued on or after
January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee, certificate
administrator, securities administration, paying agent or custodian services,
as defined in the transaction agreements, excluding publicly-issued securities
sponsored or issued by any government sponsored entity (the Platform ), as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv) 
1122(d)(4)(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the
activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this
report. Refer to Appendix A of Management s Assertion of Compliance for the
asset backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s
compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than
all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise
the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to
the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected
transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the
servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine
whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that
may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company
during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any
other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing
compliance with criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and
1122(d)(4)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed
by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2023 that required these
servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. 

We
are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related
to our examination engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023 for the platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
