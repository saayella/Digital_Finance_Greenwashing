EXPLANATORY NOTES 

The
MSBAM 2015-C27 mortgage pool includes the following mortgage loans, each of
which is serviced pursuant to a separate pooling and servicing agreement (each,
an Outside Pooling and Servicing Agreement ): 

the 535-545 Fifth Avenue mortgage loan, which is serviced pursuant to the
MSBAM 2015-C24 pooling and servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2; 
 
 the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan, which is serviced pursuant to the MSJP
2015-HAUL trust and servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3; and 
 
 the Herald Center mortgage loan, which is serviced pursuant to the MSBAM
2015-C25 pooling and servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 4.4. 

Except
as set forth below, each of the parties to each pooling and servicing agreement
listed in the Exhibit Index both (1) participates in the servicing function for
purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB and (2) constitutes a servicer that
meets the criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Regulation AB for
purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB: 

The trustee under
a pooling and servicing agreement has a nominal role with respect to the
mortgage pool securitized pursuant to such pooling and servicing agreement. The
trustee s only servicing function is the contingent obligation to make certain
advances if the master servicer under such pooling and servicing agreement
fails to do so, while all other servicing functions are performed by other
parties. The trustee under each of the pooling and servicing agreements listed
in the Exhibit Index has confirmed to the registrant that it has not made any
such contingent advances during the reporting period, and consequently, each
such trustee does not participate in the servicing function for purposes of
Item 1122 of Regulation AB, nor does it perform the functions of a servicer for
purposes of the definition of servicer under Item 1101 of Regulation AB or
for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. 

The certificate
administrator under a pooling and servicing agreement performs various payment
administration functions solely for the securitization governed by such pooling
and servicing agreement and the mortgage pool securitized pursuant to such
pooling and servicing agreement and does not have any obligations with respect
to any other transaction. Consequently, the certificate administrator under an
Outside Pooling and Servicing Agreement does not participate in the servicing
function for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, nor does it perform the
functions of a servicer for purposes of the definition of servicer under Item
1101 of Regulation AB or for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. 

The operating
advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement represents the interests of
senior certificateholders in the transaction governed by such pooling and
servicing agreement and is responsible for monitoring the performance of the
special servicer under such pooling and servicing agreement and producing certain
reports to certificateholders relating to the resolution of the mortgage pool
securitized pursuant to such pooling and servicing agreement. The operating
advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement does not have any obligations
with respect to any other transaction and is solely obligated to perform loan
reporting functions with respect to the securitization governed by such pooling
and servicing agreement. Consequently, the operating advisor under an
Outside Pooling and Servicing Agreement neither participates in the servicing
function for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB nor performs the functions
of a servicer for purposes of the definition of servicer under Item 1101 of
Regulation AB or for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. In addition, while
the operating advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement has certain
reporting obligations in respect of the related mortgage pool, it has no
obligation to collect or disburse funds in respect of the mortgage pool or to
administer any of the underlying mortgage loans. Consequently, the
operating advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement participates in the
servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, but is not
responsible for the management or collection of the pool assets or making
allocations or distributions to holders of the asset-backed securities within
the meaning of servicer under Item 1101 of Regulation AB and does not perform
the functions of a servicer for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. 

Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association is the special servicer under the MSJP 2015-HAUL trust and
servicing agreement, pursuant to which the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan is
serviced. Because Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is not the MSBAM 2015-C27
special servicer, is not affiliated with any sponsor and services only the
U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan, which constitutes less than 5 of the mortgage
pool, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as MSJP 2015-HAUL special
servicer does not constitute a reporting servicing function participant for
purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, as specified in the Instruction 3 to
Item 1122, and does not constitute a reporting servicer for purposes of Item
1123 of Regulation AB, as specified in the Instruction to Item 1123. 

U.S. Bank
National Association, is the custodian under the MSBAM 2015-C25 pooling and
servicing agreement, pursuant to which the Herald Center mortgage loan is
serviced, and the MSJP 2015-HAUL pooling and servicing agreement, pursuant to
which the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan is serviced. Because U.S. Bank
National Association is not the MSBAM 2015-C27 custodian, is not affiliated
with any sponsor and services only the Herald Center mortgage loan and the
U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan, which constitute more than 5 but less than 10 
of the mortgage pool, U.S. Bank National Association, as MSBAM 2015-C25
custodian and MSJP 2015-HAUL custodian constitutes a reporting servicing
function participant for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, as specified
in the Instruction 3 to Item 1122, but does not constitute a reporting
 servicer for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB, as specified in the
Instruction to Item 1123. 

Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
the excluded mortgage loan special servicer under the MSBAM 2015-C24 pooling
and servicing agreement, only has obligations in respect of certain mortgage
loans sold to the MSBAM 2015-C24 securitization trust to the extent the special
servicer thereunder is affiliated with the related borrowers. Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as excluded mortgage loan special servicer under the
MSBAM 2015-C24 pooling and servicing agreement, has no obligations with respect
to the 535-545 Fifth Avenue mortgage loan or any mortgage loan included in the
MSBAM 2015-C27 mortgage pool and therefore does not constitute a reporting
 servicing function participant for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, as
specified in the Instruction 3 to Item 1122, and does not constitute a
reporting servicer for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB, as specified
in the Instruction to Item 1123. 

In March 2016, LNR Securities Holdings,
LLC, the designated representative of the 535-545 Fifth Avenue controlling note
holder, appointed LNR Partners, LLC to act as special servicer for the 535-545
Fifth Avenue mortgage loan under the MSBAM 2015-C24 pooling and servicing
agreement. On September 28, 2022, Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC
Bank, National Association was replaced as special servicer under the MSBAM
2015-C24 pooling and servicing agreement with respect to most mortgage loans in
the MSBAM 2015-C24 mortgage pool and was succeeded by LNR Partners, LLC with
respect to such mortgage loans. Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC
Bank, National Association, was replaced as special servicer with respect to
the remaining mortgage loans in the MSBAM 2015-C24 mortgage pool on December 6,
2022 and was succeeded by LNR Partners, LLC with respect to such mortgage
loans. 

LNR Partners, LLC
is the current special servicer under the MSBAM 2015-C25 pooling and servicing
agreement, pursuant to which the Herald Center mortgage loan is serviced. On
March 9, 2022, Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National
Association was replaced as special servicer under the MSBAM 2015-C25 pooling
and servicing agreement, and was succeeded by LNR Partners, LLC. 

In
addition, each of the following parties engaged the services of certain
servicing function participants and sub-servicers for the reporting period, as
set forth below: 

Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as master servicer, engaged the services of CoreLogic
Solutions, LLC as a servicing function participant in respect of the entire
mortgage pool for the reporting period. 

Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as master servicer under the MSBAM 2015-C24 pooling and
servicing agreement, pursuant to which the 535-545 Fifth Avenue mortgage loan
is serviced, engaged the services of CoreLogic Solutions, LLC as a servicing
function participant in respect of the 535-545 Fifth Avenue mortgage loan for
the reporting period. 

Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as master servicer and special servicer under the MSJP
2015-HAUL trust and servicing agreement, pursuant to which the U-HAUL Portfolio
mortgage loan is serviced, engaged the services of CoreLogic Solutions, LLC as
a servicing function participant in respect of the U-HAUL Portfolio mortgage
loan for the reporting period. 

Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
as master servicer under the MSBAM 2015-C25 pooling and servicing agreement,
pursuant to which the Herald Center mortgage loan is serviced, engaged the
services of CoreLogic Solutions, LLC as a servicing function participant in
respect of the Herald Center mortgage loan for the reporting period. 

On November 1, 2021, pursuant to the
second amended and restated servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit
99.10, Computershare Trust Company, National Association was engaged to perform
all or virtually all of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association s roles as
certificate administrator, custodian and trustee, as applicable, under (i) the

other than as follows: 

In
December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related
entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its
capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities
(RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by
Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York, IKB International and IKB
Deutsche Industriebank (together, IKB) in New York state court, and Park Royal
I LLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state court. In each case, the
plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to
investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other
things, the trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations
of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and
warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by
appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. In July
2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light s claims and certain of the
claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each
case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and
Commerzbank AG each appealed the district court s decision to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Phoenix Light dismissed its appeal in
May 2023, terminating its case. In November 2023, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
entered into an agreement with IKB to resolve IKB s claims. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an
action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar
allegations. 

U.S.
Bank National Association U.S. Bank and other large financial institutions
have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain
residential mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts. The
complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank
and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a
result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers
to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs
generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported failures
to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches
of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events
of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan
servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events
of default. 

U.S.
Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under
the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to
investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends
to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank
cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible
impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. 

On
March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory
trusts (the DSTs that issued securities backed by student loans (the
 Student Loans filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S.
Bank National Association U.S. Bank in its capacities as indenture trustee
and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their
respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student
Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master
Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al., C.A. No.
2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as amended on
June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported
misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the
trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the
NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S.
Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain
allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action. 

U.S.
Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its
entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6)
or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes
involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018,
the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution
of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order
consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits
pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student
Loans, which remains pending. 

U.S.
Bank denies liability in the NCMSLT Action and believes it has performed its

closed prior to January 1, 2006 and for which the Company outsources all
material servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) to a party other

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its
roles on the CMBS Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As
of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo had not transferred to
Computershare the roles associated with its trustee, securities administration,
paying agent services, and/or related services, and the duties, rights, and
liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the CMBS
Platform transactions. During all or a portion of the Period, for all the
CMBS Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 
to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction
agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is
a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the CMBS
Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing
activities performed by Computershare for the CMBS Platform (the Computershare
Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is
taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s
compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the CMBS
Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

1 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare Corporate Trust-
CMBS Platform 

The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company,
National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management
has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing
platform for the period as follows: 

Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells
Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its
Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ).
Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS
systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. 

For the CMBS Platform (defined
below) transactions and during the Period (defined below), the Company either
(i) served directly in the related trustee, securities administration, paying
agent, and/or related roles (collectively, the CMBS Platform Roles ),
or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS
Platform Roles. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo
CTS business on November 1, 2021, including during the Period, the Company has (i)
closed new CMBS transactions and (ii) completed the transfer of certain CMBS
transaction roles from Wells Fargo CTS to Computershare, for which, in each
case, during all or a portion of the Period, the Company performed the related
CMBS Platform Roles directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). 
The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the
overall CMBS Platform transactions for the Period. For a significant majority
of CMBS Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the
Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform
Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). For the Company s
Agent Role Transactions, Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the
Period, transferred to Computershare the CMBS Platform Roles for the Company s
Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a
portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for
such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role
Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a
party participating in the servicing function with respect to the CMBS
Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing
its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant
to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the CMBS Platform, as
of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

Period : As
of January 1, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of commercial mortgage-backed
securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage
loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in
the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration
statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the
issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to
an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it
acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an
assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any
transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ). Appendix A 
identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting
the CMBS Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria : All servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to either the Company s obligations, or
the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in
either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS
Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ),
except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii),
1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not
applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the CMBS Platform for
the Period; provided however that, with respect to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing
criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations related
to the aggregation of information received and the conveyance of such
information, in each case, as required by the transaction agreements, and (b) servicing
criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations
related to the process of making or effecting an addition, removal or
substitution to the asset pool in accordance with the transaction agreements (the
 Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 

Third
parties classified as vendors : 
With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company engaged a vendor
to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing obligations required by the
servicing criterion. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for
transactions in the CMBS Platform, the Company engaged, at times during the
Period, one vendor, and at other times during the Period, two vendors, in each
case to make certain payments by check to investors and/or third parties, and
to safeguard certain unissued checks. In each case, Management has determined
that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to each vendor
as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has
policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that
the activities of each vendor comply in all material respects with the
servicing criterion applicable to each vendor. Management is solely
responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to
apply C DI 200.06 for each vendor and the related servicing criterion.

With respect to the CMBS
Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the
Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. 
 Management is responsible for
assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. 
 Management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing
criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 , as
described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria
set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item
1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), and 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has
determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with
respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that
would require the Company to perform such activities. 

4. 
 Based on such assessment for the
Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Document Custody Platform 

The management Management of the Corporate
Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company 
or Wells Fargo is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation
AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined
that the servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform
for the period as follows: 

Sale of Corporate Trust
Services Business . On
November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially
all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to Computershare
Trust Company, N.A. Computershare Trust Company ), Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
Limited , and collectively with Computershare Trust Company and CDTC, Computershare ).
Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS
systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. See Appendix B for more information regarding such
transition as it relates to the Document Custody Platform (defined
below). 

Period : 
As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed
securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company was appointed to provide
document custody services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued
securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on
or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such
RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after January 1,
2006 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an
obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB;
provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the
offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity,
other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the Document Custody Platform ). As a result of
Wells Fargo s sale of the CTS division to Computershare, Wells Fargo has not
accepted any new appointments to provide document custody services after
November 1, 2021, other than a few exceptions to facilitate the transition of
the CTS business to Computershare. Appendix A identifies the
individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period : Management has determined that the following
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are relevant to the servicing
activities performed by the Company with respect to the Document Custody
Platform transactions for the Period: Item 1122(d)(1)(ii) and
1122(d)(1)(iv) (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management
has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are
not applicable to the Company s servicing activities with respect to the
Document Custody Platform for the Period. 

With respect to the Document
Custody Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment
of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. 
 Management is responsible for assessing
the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. 
 Management has assessed the Company s
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In performing this
assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 Based on such assessment for the Period,
the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Period. 

KPMG LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to
Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its
roles on the Document Custody Platform transactions to Computershare is
ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo had not
transferred to Computershare its document custody related roles, and the
duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements
for any of the Document Custody Platform transactions. During all or a
portion of the Period, for all the Document Custody Platform transactions,
Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform
virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements.
 As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party
participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody
Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing
activities performed by Computershare for the Document Custody Platform (the Computershare
Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is
taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing
Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023. 

1 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare Corporate Trust -
Document Custody Platform 

The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National
Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has
determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform
for the period as follows: 

Purchase of corporate trust
business . On November 1, 2021, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold
substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to
the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and
Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with
the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of
Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices
transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 

For the Document Custody
Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period (defined below),
the Company either (i) served directly in the related document custody services
role (collectively, the Document Custody Platform Role ), or (ii)
served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody
Platform Role. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS
business on November 1, 2021, including during the Period, the Company has (i) closed
new document custody transactions and (ii) completed the transfer of certain
document custody transaction roles from Wells Fargo CTS to Computershare, for
which, in each case, during all or a portion of the Period, the Company
performed the related Document Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s
Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions
comprise a minority of the overall Document Custody Platform transactions for
the Period. For a significant majority of the Document Custody Platform
transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as
agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform
Role (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). For the Company s Agent
Role Transactions, Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period,
transferred to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role, and therefore
the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of
Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a
result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo
have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing
function with respect to the Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the
Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing
activities performed by the Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of
and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

Period : As
of January 1, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed
securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company provides document custody
services , either directly in the related role for such
services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for
which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and
ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to
a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions
were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption
from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has
an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB;
provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the
offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity,
other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(the Document Custody Platform ). Appendix A identifies the
individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria : Management has determined
that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the Company s
obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately
acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with
respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s
Obligations provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform,
servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the
Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related
to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction
agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management has
determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not
applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the Document Custody Platform
for the Period. 

Third parties classified as
vendors : With respect to servicing
criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), for certain ABS transactions included
in the Document Custody Platform, the Company has engaged a vendor to handle
certain aspects of maintaining and safeguarding pool assets, the security
thereon, and related documents as required by such servicing criteria. 
Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii) applicable to this vendor as permitted by the
SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors
Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining
that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for
the vendor and the related servicing criteria. 

With respect to the Document
Custody Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment
of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. 
 Management is responsible for
assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. 
 Management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the
servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI
200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used
the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph
(d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no
activities performed during the Period with respect to the Document Custody
Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the
Company to perform such activities. 

4. 
 Based on such assessment for the Period,
the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Period. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

2023 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable
Servicing Criteria 

Management of Wells Fargo Commercial
Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (the
 Company is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities
and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of commercial and multifamily
loans (the Platform ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii),
1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv),
which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it
performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December
31, 2023. Appendix A to this letter identifies the commercial mortgage and
multifamily pools and other structures involving the commercial and multifamily
loans constituting the Platform. Appendix B to this letter identifies the
applicable servicing criteria with respect to the Platform. 

With respect to servicing
criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company performs applicable
activities covered by these criteria, with respect to the Platform, except the
Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain tax payment activities. Such
vendor has provided a separate Regulation AB Item 1122 management assessment
and attestation for such activities. 

With respect to applicable
servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), there were no activities performed during
the year ended December 31, 2023, with respect to the Platform, because there
were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities. 

With respect to servicing
criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii),
the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by
these servicing criteria. The Company s management has determined that none of
these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and the Company s management has elected to take responsibility
for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor
as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06)
(formerly SEC Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations 17.06).
The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company s management is
solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria. 

The Company s management has
assessed the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Based on such assessment,
management believes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the
Company has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange
Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 

The Company has not identified
and is not aware of any material instance of noncompliance by the Vendors with
the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2023, or for the Reporting
Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

The Company has not identified
any material deficiency in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance
by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2023,
or for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

KPMG LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to
management s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Management s
Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria 

Re: 
Assessment of Compliance for services provided pursuant to the Pooling and
Servicing Agreements entered into by CWCapital Asset Management LLC beginning
January 1, 2005 and; as of and for the 12- month period ended December 31,
2023. 

CWCapital
Asset Management LLC CWCAM is responsible for assessing compliance with
applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of Regulation AB of
the Securities and Exchange Commission for the securitizations issued beginning
January 1, 2005, as listed on Appendix A Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 

CWCAM
has assessed its compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of
December 31, 2023 and for the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023
(the Reporting Period ). In making this assessment, management used the
criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d)
of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, excluding the criteria set forth in Item 1122
(d)(1)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(B), (d)(3)(i)(C), (d)(3)(i)(D), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii),
(d)(3)(iv), (d)(4)(v), (d)(4)(ix), (d)(4)(x), (d)(4)(xi), (d)(4)(xii),
(d)(4)(xiii), (d)(4)(xiv), and (d)(4)(xv) of Regulation AB, which CWCAM has
concluded are not applicable to the activities it performs (collectively, the
 Not Applicable Criteria ). With respect to applicable servicing criteria
(d)(1)(ii), (d)(2)(vi), (d)(4)(i), (d)(4)(iii), and (d)(4)(iv), CWCAM has
determined that there were no occurrences of events that would require CWCAM to
perform such activities. The securitizations covered by this report include all
securitizations wherein CWCAM is named as the Special Servicer for
securitizations issued beginning January 1, 2005, as listed in Appendix B (the
 Platform ). 

Based
on such assessment, management believes, as of December 31, 2023 and for the
Reporting Period, the following: 

 1) 
 CWCAM has determined that the Not
Applicable Criteria are in fact not applicable to the activities it performs
with respect to the Platform. 

 2) 
 CWCAM has complied in all material
respects with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122. 

CohnReznick
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
attestation report on CWCAM s management s assessment of compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the 12-month period ended December
31, 2023.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The
Board of Directors 

 Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association: 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying ASSESSMENT OF
COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA, that the Corporate Trust
Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for commercial
mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial
mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company was appointed to perform
trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related services,
and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such CMBS
transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement
delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued
securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an
exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided
however that, (i) the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, and
(ii) the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities
were issued pursuant to a transaction that closed prior to January 1, 2006 and
for which the Company outsources all material servicing activities (as defined
by Regulation AB) to a party other than Computershare Trust Company or any
affiliate thereof (the CMBS Platform as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023. Appendix A to the ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE
APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA identifies the individual asset-backed transactions
and securities defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. 

The
Company s management has determined that the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv) and 1122(d)(2)(iii) are applicable to the
servicing activities performed by the Company with respect to the CMBS Platform
as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and servicing criterion
1122(d)(2)(vi) is applicable to the servicing activities performed by the
Company with respect to the CMBS Platform from January 1, 2023 through October
9, 2023 (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). With respect to
Applicable Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(2)(iii), Management has determined that
there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31,
2023 with respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of
events that would require the Company to perform such activities. The Company s
management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) are not applicable to the Company because the Company does not perform
activities with respect to the CMBS Platform relating to those servicing criteria.
Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation
standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test
basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed
transactions and securities that comprise the CMBS Platform, testing selected
servicing activities related to the CMBS Platform, and determining whether the
Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. Furthermore,
our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination
engagement. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects. 

We
do not express an opinion or any form of assurance on the statements in Appendix
B to the ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Audit Committee of
Computershare Trust Company, National Association 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate Trust - CMBS Platform 
that Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company complied
with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and
Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage-backed
securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans
and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in
the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration
statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the
issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to
an exemption from registration and either the Company (and/or the party for
whom it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to
deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform
excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued,
sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.
government or any government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ), as of December
31, 2023 and for the year then ended (the Period ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not
applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party
for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related
transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period (as
applicable, the Company s Obligations provided however that, with respect
to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only
to the Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received
and the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the
transaction agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is
applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the process of making
or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in
accordance with the transaction agreements. 

As described in management's
assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company
has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB,
and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB
and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation
200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted
that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Appendix A to management's
assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities
defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. 

The Company s management is
responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination
included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that
comprise the CMBS Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to
the CMBS Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected
transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect
noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent
to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe
that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be
independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with
the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December
31, 2023 for the CMBS Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that
Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB
(the Servicing Criteria) for Commercial and Multifamily Loans (the Platform),
except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D),
1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has
determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the
Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company has
determined that servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii) are
applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform,
except for certain tax payment activities that the Company has engaged various
vendors to perform. With respect to applicable servicing criterion
1122(d)(4)(iii), the Company has determined that there were no activities
performed during the year ended December 31, 2023 with respect to the Platform
because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to
perform such activities. Appendix A to the 2023 Certification Regarding
Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual
asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting
the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the
Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on
our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the
Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected
asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing
selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether
the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the Servicing Criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination
engagement. 

As
described in the accompanying 2023 Certification Regarding Compliance with
Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i),
1122(d)(4)(vi), and for certain activities related to 1122(d)(4)(xi), and
1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the
activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined
that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility
for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor
as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation
(C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As
permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors 
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and
related servicing criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no
procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage
Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, complied with
the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii) for which
compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

securities transactions that were issued on or after January 1, 2005 and that
were registered with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 for which
CWCapital Asset Management, LLC acted as the special servicer listed in
Appendix B Platform included in the accompanying Management's
Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria Management's
Assertion as of December 31, 2023 and for the period from January 1,
2023 to December 31, 2023. Management has determined that the criteria set
forth in Section 1122 (d)(1)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(B), (d)(3)(i)(C), (d)(3)(i)(D),
(d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), (d)(3)(iv), (d)(4)(v), (d)(4)(ix), (d)(4)(x),
(d)(4)(xi), (d)(4)(xii), (d)(4)(xiii), (d)(4)(xiv), and (d)(4)(xv) are not
applicable to the activities performed by the Company as a special servicer
with respect to the Company's Platform. The Company's management is responsible
for its Management's Assertion and compliance with those servicing criteria.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Management's Assertion about the
Company's compliance with the servicing criteria applicable thereon under

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the
servicing activities as a special servicer, determining whether the Company
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria
during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to
selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included
servicing activities related to each commercial mortgage-backed securities
transaction. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance
arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above
that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the
Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our
examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We
are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to
the engagement. 

Our

the Company performed servicing activities related to those transactions and
securities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the period
covered by this report. Accordingly, our testing may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction or security
constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was not designed to detect
material noncompliance that may have occurred prior to the period covered by
this report and that may have affected the Company s servicing activities
during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Situs Holdings, LLC complied with the
aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2023 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

that CoreLogic Solutions, LLC. (the Company complied with the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage loan outsourcing

1122(d)(1)(i iii), 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(2)(iii iv),
1122(d)(3)(i iv), 1122(d)(4)(i x), and 1122(d)(4)(xii xv), which management has

about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Members of 

 LNR
Partners, LLC: 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management
Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria
included on Appendix A, that LNR Partners, LLC (the Company complied with
the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial mortgaged backed securities
transactions for which the Company served as special servicer and that were
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the
 Platform ), excluding criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), (3)(i)(C), (3)(i)(D),
(3)(ii), (3)(iii), (3)(iv), (4)(v), (4)(ix), (4)(x), (4)(xi), (4)(xii),
(4)(xiii), (4)(xiv) and (4) (xv) (the servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2023, which management has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the
Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the
servicing criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the
servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material
respects, an examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence
about management s assertion on compliance with the servicing criteria. The
nature, timing and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment,
including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of management s
assertion on compliance with the servicing criteria, whether due to error or
fraud, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a
sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the
servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were
limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have
included servicing activities related to each asset backed transaction included
in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect
noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period
specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe
that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria Item
1122(d)(2)(vii), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain activities
required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this
vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation
AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s
 Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company
has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material
respects with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor. The Company is
solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023, for the commercial mortgage backed securities Platform is fairly stated,
in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors 

 U.S. Bank National Association
and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with
Applicable Servicing Criteria, that U.S. Bank National Association and U.S.
Bank Trust Company, National Association (collectively, the Company complied
with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and
Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust
Asset-Backed Securities Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company
provides trustee, securities administration, registrar, paying agent and
document custody services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023,
except for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv),
which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it
performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report.
Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing
criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion
about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our
examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the
individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform,
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria.
Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and
servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this
report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have
occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the
balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions.
Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items
1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were
no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December
31, 2023 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe
that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We are required to be
independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in
accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination
engagement. 

Our examination does not
provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust
Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
