EXPLANATORY NOTES 

The MSBAM 2015-C21
mortgage pool includes the following mortgage loans, each of which is serviced
pursuant to a separate pooling and servicing agreement (each, an Outside
Pooling and Servicing Agreement ): 

the Discovery Business Center mortgage loan, which is serviced pursuant to the
MSBAM 2015-C20 pooling and servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2. 

Except as set forth below,
each of the parties to each pooling and servicing agreement listed in the
Exhibit Index both (1) participates in the servicing function for purposes of
Item 1122 of Regulation AB and (2) constitutes a servicer that meets the
criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Regulation AB for purposes of
Item 1123 of Regulation AB: 

The trustee under a pooling and servicing agreement has a nominal role with
respect to the mortgage pool securitized pursuant to such pooling and servicing
agreement. The trustee s only servicing function is the contingent obligation
to make certain advances if the master servicer under such pooling and
servicing agreement fails to do so, while all other servicing functions are
performed by other parties. The trustee under each of the pooling and servicing
agreements listed in the Exhibit Index has confirmed to the registrant that it
has not made any such contingent advances during the reporting period, and
consequently, each such trustee does not participate in the servicing function
for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, nor does it perform the functions
of a servicer for purposes of the definition of servicer under Item 1101 of
Regulation AB or for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. 

The certificate administrator under a pooling and servicing agreement performs
various payment administration functions solely for the securitization governed
by such pooling and servicing agreement and the mortgage pool securitized
pursuant to such pooling and servicing agreement and does not have any
obligations with respect to any other transaction. Consequently, the
certificate administrator under an Outside Pooling and Servicing Agreement does
not participate in the servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB, nor does it perform the functions of a servicer for purposes of
the definition of servicer under Item 1101 of Regulation AB or for purposes
of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. 

The operating advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement represents the
interests of senior certificateholders in the transaction governed by such
pooling and servicing agreement and is responsible for monitoring the
performance of the special servicer under such pooling and servicing agreement
and producing certain reports to certificateholders relating to the resolution
of the mortgage pool securitized pursuant to such pooling and servicing
agreement. The operating advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement does
not have any obligations with respect to any other transaction and is solely
obligated to perform loan reporting functions with respect to the
securitization governed by such pooling and servicing agreement. 
Consequently, the operating advisor under an Outside Pooling and Servicing
Agreement neither participates in the servicing function for purposes of Item
1122 of Regulation AB nor performs the functions of a servicer for purposes of
the definition of servicer under Item 1101 of Regulation AB or for purposes
of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. In addition, while the operating advisor under a
pooling and servicing agreement has certain reporting obligations in respect of
the related mortgage pool, it has no obligation to collect or disburse funds in
respect of the mortgage pool or to administer any of the underlying mortgage
loans. Consequently, the operating advisor under a pooling and servicing
agreement participates in the servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB, but is not responsible for the management or collection of the
pool assets or making allocations or distributions to holders of the
asset-backed securities within the meaning of servicer under Item 1101 of
Regulation AB and does not perform the functions of a servicer for purposes of
Item 1123 of Regulation AB. 

Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association is the
master servicer under the MSBAM 2015-C20 pooling and servicing agreement,
pursuant to which the Discovery Business Center mortgage loan is serviced.
Because Midland Loan Services is not the MSBAM 2015-C21 master servicer, is not
affiliated with any sponsor and services only the Discovery Business Center
mortgage loan, which constitutes more than 5 but less than 10 of the mortgage
pool, Midland Loan Services, as MSBAM 2015-C20 master servicer constitutes a
reporting servicing function participant for purposes of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB, as specified in the Instruction 3 to Item 1122, but does not
constitute a reporting servicer for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB,
as specified in the Instruction to Item 1123. 

Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC is the current special servicer under the MSBAM
2015-C20 pooling and servicing agreement, pursuant to which the Discovery
Business Center mortgage loan is serviced. In July 2018, CWCapital Asset Management
LLC was replaced as special servicer under the MSBAM 2015-C20 pooling and
servicing agreement and was succeeded by Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC. Because
Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC is not the MSBAM 2015-C21 special servicer, is not
affiliated with any sponsor and services only the Discovery Business Center
mortgage loan, which constitutes more than 5 but less than 10 of the mortgage
pool, Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC, as MSBAM 2015-C20 special servicer
constitutes a reporting servicing function participant for purposes of Item
1122 of Regulation AB, as specified in the Instruction 3 to Item 1122, but does
not constitute a reporting servicer for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation
AB, as specified in the Instruction to Item 1123. 

Mount Street US (Georgia) LLP is the current special servicer under the MSBAM
2015-C21 pooling and servicing agreement. On August 16, 2021, LNR Partners, LLC
and CWCapital Asset Management LLC were replaced as general special servicer
and excluded mortgage loan special servicer, respectively, under the MSBAM
2015-C21 pooling and servicing agreement, and were succeeded by Mount Street US
(Georgia) LLP. LNR Partners, LLC remains the special servicer under the MSBAM
2015-C21 pooling and servicing agreement solely with respect to the 555 11th
Street NW mortgage loan. 

In addition, each of
the following parties engaged the services of certain servicing function
participants and sub-servicers for the reporting period, as set forth below: 

KeyBank National Association, as master servicer, engaged the services of
Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC, as a sub-servicer in respect of the entire
mortgage pool for the reporting period. 

KeyBank National Association, as master
servicer, engaged the services of NorthMarq Capital, LLC, as a servicing
function participant in respect of 6.38 of the pool for the reporting period. 

On November 1, 2021, pursuant to the
second amended and restated servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit
99.7, Computershare Trust Company, National Association was engaged to perform
all or virtually all of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association s roles as
certificate administrator, custodian and trustee, as applicable, under (i) the
pooling and servicing agreement and (ii) each Outside Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

other than as follows: 

In
December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related
entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its
capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities
(RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by
Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York, IKB International and IKB
Deutsche Industriebank (together, IKB) in New York state court, and Park Royal
I LLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state court. In each case, the
plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to
investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things,
the trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of
mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties,
notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate
standards of care following alleged events of default. In July 2022, the
district court dismissed Phoenix Light s claims and certain of the claims
asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each case in
favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank
AG each appealed the district court s decision to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit. Phoenix Light dismissed its appeal in May 2023,
terminating its case. In November 2023, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into an
agreement with IKB to resolve IKB s claims. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. previously
settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed
by the National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations.

THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA

The management Management of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association (the Company or Wells Fargo is responsible for
assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are
applicable in regard to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 

Sale
of Corporate Trust Services Business . 
On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold
substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. Computershare Trust Company ),
Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with Computershare Trust
Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells
Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices
transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. See Appendix B 
for more information regarding such transition as it relates to the CMBS
Platform (defined below). 

Period : As of and for the twelve months ended December
31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of commercial
mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of
commercial mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company was
appointed to perform trustee, securities administration, paying agent services,
and/or related services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued
securities for such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a
registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
or (b) the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered
pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation
under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with
the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, (i) the platform excludes any
transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government-sponsored entity, and (ii) the platform excludes any transactions
for which the offered securities were issued pursuant to a transaction that
closed prior to January 1, 2006 and for which the Company outsources all
material servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) to a party other
than Computershare Trust Company or any affiliate thereof (the CMBS
Platform ). As a result of Wells Fargo s sale of the CTS division to
Computershare, Wells Fargo has not accepted any appointments to perform
trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related
services on new CMBS transactions after November 1, 2021, other than a few
exceptions to facilitate the transition of the CTS business to Computershare.
 Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management
as constituting the CMBS Platform for the Period.

Criteria for the Period : 
Management has determined that the following servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) are relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company
with respect to the CMBS Platform transactions for the Period: 
1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) from January 1, 2023
through December 31, 2023, and 1122(d)(2)(vi) from January 1, 2023 through
October 9, 2023 (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management
has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are
not applicable to the Company s servicing activities with respect to the CMBS
Platform for the Period.

3. 
 With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criterion 1122(d)(2)(iii), Management has determined that there were no
activities performed during the Period with respect to the CMBS Platform,

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its
roles on the CMBS Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As
of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo had not transferred to
Computershare the roles associated with its trustee, securities administration,
paying agent services, and/or related services, and the duties, rights, and
liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the CMBS
Platform transactions. During all or a portion of the Period, for all the
CMBS Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 
to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction
agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is
a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the CMBS
Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing
activities performed by Computershare for the CMBS Platform (the Computershare
Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is
taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s
compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the CMBS
Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

1 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare Corporate Trust-
CMBS Platform 

The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company,
National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management
has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing
platform for the period as follows: 

Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells
Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its
Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ).
Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS
systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. 

For the CMBS Platform (defined
below) transactions and during the Period (defined below), the Company either
(i) served directly in the related trustee, securities administration, paying
agent, and/or related roles (collectively, the CMBS Platform Roles ),
or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS
Platform Roles. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo
CTS business on November 1, 2021, including during the Period, the Company has (i)
closed new CMBS transactions and (ii) completed the transfer of certain CMBS
transaction roles from Wells Fargo CTS to Computershare, for which, in each
case, during all or a portion of the Period, the Company performed the related
CMBS Platform Roles directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). 
The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the
overall CMBS Platform transactions for the Period. For a significant majority
of CMBS Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the
Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform
Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). For the Company s
Agent Role Transactions, Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the
Period, transferred to Computershare the CMBS Platform Roles for the Company s
Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a
portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for
such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role
Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a
party participating in the servicing function with respect to the CMBS
Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing
its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant
to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the CMBS Platform, as
of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

Period : As
of January 1, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of commercial mortgage-backed
securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage
loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in
the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration
statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the
issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to
an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it
acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an
assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any
transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ). Appendix A 
identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting
the CMBS Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria : All servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to either the Company s obligations, or
the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in
either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS
Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ),
except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii),
1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not
applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the CMBS Platform for
the Period; provided however that, with respect to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing
criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations related
to the aggregation of information received and the conveyance of such
information, in each case, as required by the transaction agreements, and (b) servicing
criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations
related to the process of making or effecting an addition, removal or
substitution to the asset pool in accordance with the transaction agreements (the
 Applicable Servicing Criteria ).

parties classified as vendors : 
With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company engaged a vendor
to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing obligations required by the
servicing criterion. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for
transactions in the CMBS Platform, the Company engaged, at times during the
Period, one vendor, and at other times during the Period, two vendors, in each
case to make certain payments by check to investors and/or third parties, and
to safeguard certain unissued checks. In each case, Management has determined
that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to each vendor
as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has
policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that
the activities of each vendor comply in all material respects with the
servicing criterion applicable to each vendor. Management is solely
responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to
apply C DI 200.06 for each vendor and the related servicing criterion.

With respect to the CMBS
Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the
Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. 
 Management is responsible for
assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. 
 Management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing
criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 , as
described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria
set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item
1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), and 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has
determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with
respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that
would require the Company to perform such activities. 

4. 
 Based on such assessment for the
Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an

THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Document Custody Platform 

The management Management of the Corporate
Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company 
or Wells Fargo is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation
AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined
that the servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform
for the period as follows: 

Sale of Corporate Trust
Services Business . On
November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially
all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to Computershare
Trust Company, N.A. Computershare Trust Company ), Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
Limited , and collectively with Computershare Trust Company and CDTC, Computershare ).
Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS
systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. See Appendix B for more information regarding such
transition as it relates to the Document Custody Platform (defined
below). 

Period : 
As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed
securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company was appointed to provide
document custody services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued
securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on
or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such
RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after January 1,
2006 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an
obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB;
provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the
offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity,
other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the Document Custody Platform ). As a result of
Wells Fargo s sale of the CTS division to Computershare, Wells Fargo has not
accepted any new appointments to provide document custody services after
November 1, 2021, other than a few exceptions to facilitate the transition of
the CTS business to Computershare. Appendix A identifies the
individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period : Management has determined that the following
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are relevant to the servicing
activities performed by the Company with respect to the Document Custody
Platform transactions for the Period: Item 1122(d)(1)(ii) and
1122(d)(1)(iv) (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management
has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are
not applicable to the Company s servicing activities with respect to the
Document Custody Platform for the Period. 

With respect to the Document
Custody Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment
of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. 
 Management is responsible for assessing
the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. 
 Management has assessed the Company s
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In performing this
assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 Based on such assessment for the Period,
the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Period. 

KPMG LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to
Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its
roles on the Document Custody Platform transactions to Computershare is
ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo had not
transferred to Computershare its document custody related roles, and the
duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements
for any of the Document Custody Platform transactions. During all or a
portion of the Period, for all the Document Custody Platform transactions,
Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform
virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements.
 As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party
participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody
Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing
activities performed by Computershare for the Document Custody Platform (the Computershare
Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is
taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing
Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023. 

1 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare Corporate Trust -
Document Custody Platform 

The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National
Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has
determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform
for the period as follows: 

Purchase of corporate trust
business . On November 1, 2021, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold
substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to
the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and
Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with
the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of
Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices
transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 

For the Document Custody
Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period (defined below),
the Company either (i) served directly in the related document custody services
role (collectively, the Document Custody Platform Role ), or (ii)
served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody
Platform Role. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS
business on November 1, 2021, including during the Period, the Company has (i) closed
new document custody transactions and (ii) completed the transfer of certain
document custody transaction roles from Wells Fargo CTS to Computershare, for
which, in each case, during all or a portion of the Period, the Company
performed the related Document Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s
Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions
comprise a minority of the overall Document Custody Platform transactions for
the Period. For a significant majority of the Document Custody Platform
transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as
agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform
Role (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). For the Company s Agent
Role Transactions, Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period,
transferred to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role, and therefore
the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of
Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a
result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo
have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing
function with respect to the Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the
Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing
activities performed by the Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of
and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

Period : As
of January 1, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed
securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company provides document custody
services , either directly in the related role for such
services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for
which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and
ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to
a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions
were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption
from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has
an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB;
provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the
offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity,
other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(the Document Custody Platform ). Appendix A identifies the
individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria : Management has determined
that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the Company s
obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately
acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with
respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s
Obligations provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform,
servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the
Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related
to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction
agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management has
determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not
applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the Document Custody Platform
for the Period. 

Third parties classified as
vendors : With respect to servicing
criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), for certain ABS transactions included
in the Document Custody Platform, the Company has engaged a vendor to handle
certain aspects of maintaining and safeguarding pool assets, the security
thereon, and related documents as required by such servicing criteria. 
Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii) applicable to this vendor as permitted by the
SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors
Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining
that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for
the vendor and the related servicing criteria. 

With respect to the Document
Custody Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment
of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. 
 Management is responsible for
assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. 
 Management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the
servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI
200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used
the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph
(d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no
activities performed during the Period with respect to the Document Custody
Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the
Company to perform such activities. 

4. 
 Based on such assessment for the Period,
the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Period. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

MANAGEMENT'S
ASSERTION ON 

 COMPLIANCE WITH
REGULATION AB SERVICING CRITERIA 

KeyBank
National Association, as successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital
Markets, Inc. (the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing
compliance for the transactions listed on Appendix A for the period January 1,
2023 through December 31, 2023 (the Reporting Period ), with the
servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of
Federal Regulations (the CFR ), except for the servicing criteria
which the Asserting Party has concluded are not applicable, as indicated on
Appendix B attached hereto (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ), to
the servicing of the transactions listed on Appendix A, backed by commercial
real estate mortgage loans and serviced by the Asserting Party. Although the
Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance with Section 229.1122
(d)(l)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by
the Asserting Party during the year ended December 31, 2023, that required this
servicing criteria to be complied with. 

The
Asserting Party has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party has
complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria for
the transactions listed on Appendix A backed by commercial real estate mortgage
loans serviced by the Asserting Party. 

The
Asserting Party has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by the
servicing criteria as set forth in Appendix B. The Asserting Party has
determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined
in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Asserting Party has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section
200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06. As permitted
by C DI 200.06, the Asserting Party has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's
activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable
to the vendor. The Asserting Party is solely responsible for determining that
it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and
related criteria. 

Ernst
 Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

concluded are not applicable, as indicated on Appendix B attached hereto (the
 Applicable Servicing Criteria ), to the servicing of the transactions listed

engaged certain vendors to perform specific, limited activities related to the Applicable Servicing Criteria . The Asserting Party
has determined that any such vendor is not a servicer as defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Asserting Party has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with any portion of the Applicable
Servicing Criteria performed by any such vendor as permitted by Regulation AB
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation
Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06. As
permitted by C DI 200.06, the Asserting Party asserts that it has policies
and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the
vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor and that the Asserting Party is not aware of any
material deficiency in such policies and procedures nor of any material
instance of noncompliance by any such vendors with respect to the Applicable
Servicing Criteria. The Asserting Party is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for any such vendor
and related criteria. 

Marcum LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the
assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the

Northmarq

as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Reporting Period with
the servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code
of Federal Regulations. The assessment concerns the Asserting Party s servicing
efforts for its servicing Platform, which consists of all the commercial
loans serviced by the Asserting Party that are (1) associated with any
registered offering of asset-backed securities commencing with an initial bona
fide offer after December 31, 2005, or (2) encompassed by contractual

its compliance. 

The
Asserting Party has engaged a vendor to perform specific and limited lockbox
activities in relation to Servicing Criterion (d)(2)(i). The Asserting Party
has also engaged a vendor to perform specific, defined legal work, and a vendor
to perform specific force-placed insurance work, both vendors efforts
occurring in relation to Servicing Criterion (d)(1)(ii) as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2023. The Asserting Party elects to take responsibility for
assessing these vendors compliance with Servicing Criterion (d)(1)(ii) and
(d)(2)(i). 

The
Asserting Party has also engaged a vendor to perform generalized work related
to performing tax searches, payment of taxes, reporting of tax information, and
issuance of flood insurance certifications. The Asserting Party requires this
vendor to provide to the Asserting Party a Report of their assessment of
compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, as the means of assessing the
vendor s compliance with Servicing Criterion (d)(1)(ii). 

The
Asserting Party has assessed its compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party
has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria
as of December 31, 2023, and for the Reporting Period with respect to the

The
Board of Directors 

 Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association: 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying ASSESSMENT OF
COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA, that the Corporate Trust
Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for commercial
mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial
mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company was appointed to perform
trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related services,
and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such CMBS
transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement
delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued
securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an
exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided
however that, (i) the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, and
(ii) the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities
were issued pursuant to a transaction that closed prior to January 1, 2006 and
for which the Company outsources all material servicing activities (as defined
by Regulation AB) to a party other than Computershare Trust Company or any
affiliate thereof (the CMBS Platform as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023. Appendix A to the ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE
APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA identifies the individual asset-backed transactions
and securities defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. 

The
Company s management has determined that the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv) and 1122(d)(2)(iii) are applicable to the
servicing activities performed by the Company with respect to the CMBS Platform
as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and servicing criterion
1122(d)(2)(vi) is applicable to the servicing activities performed by the
Company with respect to the CMBS Platform from January 1, 2023 through October
9, 2023 (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). With respect to
Applicable Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(2)(iii), Management has determined that
there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31,
2023 with respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of
events that would require the Company to perform such activities. The Company s
management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) are not applicable to the Company because the Company does not perform
activities with respect to the CMBS Platform relating to those servicing criteria.
Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation
standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test
basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed
transactions and securities that comprise the CMBS Platform, testing selected
servicing activities related to the CMBS Platform, and determining whether the
Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. Furthermore,
our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination
engagement. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects. 

We
do not express an opinion or any form of assurance on the statements in Appendix
B to the ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Audit Committee of
Computershare Trust Company, National Association 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate Trust - CMBS Platform 
that Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company complied
with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and
Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage-backed
securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans
and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in
the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration
statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the
issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to
an exemption from registration and either the Company (and/or the party for
whom it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to
deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform
excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued,
sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.
government or any government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ), as of December
31, 2023 and for the year then ended (the Period ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not
applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party
for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related
transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period (as
applicable, the Company s Obligations provided however that, with respect
to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only
to the Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received
and the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the
transaction agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is
applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the process of making
or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in
accordance with the transaction agreements. 

As described in management's
assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company
has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB,
and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB
and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation
200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted
that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Appendix A to management's
assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities
defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. 

The Company s management is
responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination
included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that
comprise the CMBS Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to
the CMBS Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected
transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect
noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent
to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe
that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be
independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with
the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December
31, 2023 for the CMBS Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

1122(d)(2)(i-vii); 1122(d)(3)(i-iv); and 1122(d)(4)(iv-xv), which Management
has determined are not applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the

As described in management's
assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), the Company
has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by these servicing
criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer 
as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to
take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria

activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the

compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination
included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that

assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion on Compliance
with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that KeyBank National Association, as
successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc., (the Company)
complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for commercial real estate
mortgage loans platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, except
for Item 1122 (d)(3)(i)(b), 1122 (d)(3)(i)(c), 1122 (d)(3)(i)(d), 1122
(d)(3)(ii), 1122 (d)(3)(iii) and 1122 (d)(3)(iv), which the Company has determined
are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the
servicing platform covered by this report as noted in Appendix B of
management s assertion. See Appendix A of management s assertion for the asset
backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the
Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the
individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria
and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of
the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the
selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during
the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to
determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our
tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by
the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected
transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for
assessing compliance with Item 1122 (d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no
servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December
31, 2023 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe
that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We are required to be
independent of Key Bank National Association and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related
to our examination engagement. 

Our examination does not
provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria. 

As described in management s
assertion, for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi), the Company has engaged a
vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing criteria. The
Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by
C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures
in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities
comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the
vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as
described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the
Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In our opinion, the Company complied
with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122
(d)(4)(xi) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as
described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and
Members of 

 Mount Street US (Georgia)
LLP 

We have examined management's
assertion, included in the accompanying Management's Assertion on Compliance
with Applicable Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Mount Street US
(Georgia) (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for
asset-backed securities transactions for which the Company acted as servicer,
including commercial and multifamily mortgage loans (the Platform), as of and
for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023, excluding the
criteria set forth in items 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(a),
1122(d)(3)(i)(b), 1122(d)(3)(i)(c), 1122(d)(3)(i)(d), 1122(d)(3)(ii),
1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(v), 
1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x)(a), 
1122(d)(4)(x)(b), 1122(d)(4)(x)(c), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), 1122(d)(4)(xiv) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which
management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the
Company with respect to the Platform. Appendix A to the accompanying
Management's Assertion on Compliance with Applicable Regulation AB Servicing
Criteria identifies the asset-backed transactions defined by management as
constituting the Platform. Appendix B identifies the applicable servicing
criteria with respect to the Platform. Management is responsible for the
Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), and, accordingly, included examining, on a
test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing
activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company performed
those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the
specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing
activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report
and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities
related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Platform. Further, an
examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that
may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected
the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

We are required to be
independent of Mount Street US (Georgia) and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related
to our examination engagement. 

Our examination does not
provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria. 

With respect to applicable
servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) there was no activities performed during the
period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023 with respect to the Platform,
because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to
perform such activities. 

As described in the
accompanying management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i) and
1122(d)(2)(vii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the
activities related to the applicable servicing criteria. The Company has
determined that none of these vendors are considered a servicer as defined in
Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure
Interpretation (C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI
200.06) (formerly SEC Manual Telephone Interpretation 17.06). As permitted by
C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures
in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities
comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each
vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets with
the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related
criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with
respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB, including
servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(2)(vii) for which compliance is
determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the
period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023 for the Platform, is fairly
stated, in all material respects.

with servicing criteria set forth in Items 1117, 1119, 1122(d)(3)(i) and

attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the
Platform and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed
transactions and securities constituting the Platform and evaluating whether
the Company performed servicing activities related to those transactions and
securities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the period
covered by this report. Accordingly, our testing may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction or security
constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was not designed to detect
material noncompliance that may have occurred prior to the period covered by
this report and that may have affected the Company s servicing activities
during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a

criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Situs Holdings, LLC complied with the
aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2023 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

REPORT OF

Board
of Directors 

 Berkadia
Commercial Mortgage, LLC 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s
Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria Management s Report ), that Berkadia Commercial Mortgage, LLC (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the Primary Servicing of
Commercial Mortgage Loans within Public Securitizations (the Primary Servicing
Platform or the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023,
excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(vii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which management has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the
Platform. The Platform consists of the of the publicly issues asset-backed
transactions and securities for which the Company is named the master servicer
of commercial mortgage loans. Management is responsible for the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the
Platform and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed
transactions and securities constituting the Platform and evaluating whether
the Company performed servicing activities related to those transactions and
securities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the period
covered by this report. Accordingly, our testing may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction or security
constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was not designed to detect
material noncompliance that may have occurred prior to the period covered by
this report and that may have affected the Company s servicing activities
during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 

As
described in Management s Report, the Company engaged various vendors to
perform servicing activities with respect to criteria 1122(d)(2)(i),
1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i), and 1122(d)(4)(xi) through 1122(d)(4)(xiii).
The Company determined that each vendor is not considered a servicer, as that
term is defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and therefore, the Company is
assuming responsibility for compliance with such servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor s servicing activities. In accordance with Regulation AB and its
related interpretations, the requirement for management to assess compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to a vendor s activities is satisfied if
the Company has instituted policies and procedures to monitor whether such
vendor s activities comply in all material respects with such criteria. Compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria is achieved if those policies and
procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such vendor s activities
comply with such criteria and those policies and procedures are operating
effectively for the period covered by Management s Report. Our examination does
not provide a legal determination of whether a vendor is or is not considered a
servicer, and therefore, on whether the Company, in its Management Report, is
eligible to elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s servicing activities. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC
complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Primary Servicing Platform is fairly
stated, in all material respects.

1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vii) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which management has

for Northmarq Capital, LLC s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our
examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of
the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether the
Company performed those activities in compliance with the servicing criteria
during the specified period and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to
selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered
by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing
activities related to each asset- backed transaction in the Platform. Further,
an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that
may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected
the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

As

1122(d)(2)(i), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities
required by this servicing criterion. The Company has determined that these
vendors are not considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation
AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criterion applicable to these vendors as permitted by
Section 200.06 of the Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (Section
200.06). As permitted by Section 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has
policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that
the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing
criterion applicable to these vendors. The Company is solely responsible for
determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Section 200.06 for the
vendors and related criterion as described in its assertion, and we performed
no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to
use Section 200.06. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Northmarq Capital, LLC complied with
the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Board of Directors, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s
Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria,
that Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC Bank, National Association Midland or the Company ), complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for all
transactions serviced on the Enterprise! Loan Management System (the
 Platform as of December 31, 2023 and for the year then ended excluding
criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D),
1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the
Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed
by them with respect to the Platform. Midland s management is responsible for
its assertion and for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on
our examination. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i),
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi),
1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged
certain vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria.
The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered servicers as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06
of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules
adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company
has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material
respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is
solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all
material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed
transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected
servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the
Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures
were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by
the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts
calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report.
We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Midland complied with the
aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2023 for all transactions serviced on the Enterprise! Loan
Management System is fairly stated, in all material respects.

(d)(4)(v), (d)(4)(ix), (d)(4)(x), (d)(4)(xii), (d)(4)(xiii), (d)(4)(xiv), and
(d)(4)(xv) (the servicing criteria ), as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023, which management has determined are not applicable to the activities
performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Exhibit 1 to
management s assertion identifies the individual asset backed transactions
defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria and its assertion. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the
Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material
respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a
sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the
servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were
limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset backed transaction included in the
Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance
arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above
that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the
Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence
we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria Item
1122(d)(1)(ii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities
required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these
vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted
by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors
Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06,
the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all
material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors. The
Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for these vendors and related criteria as
described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the
Company s determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023, for the commercial mortgage loan platform, is fairly stated, in all
material respects.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Members of 

 LNR
Partners, LLC: 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management
Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria
included on Appendix A, that LNR Partners, LLC (the Company complied with
the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial mortgaged backed securities
transactions for which the Company served as special servicer and that were
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the
 Platform ), excluding criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), (3)(i)(C), (3)(i)(D),
(3)(ii), (3)(iii), (3)(iv), (4)(v), (4)(ix), (4)(x), (4)(xi), (4)(xii),
(4)(xiii), (4)(xiv) and (4) (xv) (the servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2023, which management has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the
Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the
servicing criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the
servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material
respects, an examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence
about management s assertion on compliance with the servicing criteria. The
nature, timing and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment,
including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of management s
assertion on compliance with the servicing criteria, whether due to error or
fraud, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a
sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the
servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were
limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have
included servicing activities related to each asset backed transaction included
in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect
noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period
specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe
that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria Item
1122(d)(2)(vii), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain activities
required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this
vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation
AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s
 Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company
has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material
respects with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor. The Company is
solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023, for the commercial mortgage backed securities Platform is fairly stated,
in all material respects.
