Management s
Report on Assessment of 2023 Compliance with Applicable Regulation AB Servicing
Criteria 

Greystone
Servicing Company LLC and Subsidiaries (the Asserting Party) is responsible for
assessing its compliance as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the
Reporting Period) with the servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section
229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations. The assessment concerns the
Asserting Party s servicing efforts for its servicing Platforms, which
consist of all the commercial and multifamily loans serviced by the Asserting
Party as described in Appendix I. 

The
Asserting Party is responsible for assessing its compliance with the servicing
criteria applicable to it. The Asserting Party used the criteria in paragraph
(d) of Section 1122 of Regulation AB (17 C.F.R.229.1122) to assess its
compliance. The servicing criteria applicable to the Platforms are listed in
Appendix II as indicated. 

The
Asserting Party has engaged vendors to perform generalized work related to
performing tax searches, payment on taxes, reporting of tax information, and
issuance of flood insurance certifications. The Asserting Party has determined
that these vendors are not considered servicers as defined in item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted by Section
200.06 of the Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (Section 200.06). The
Asserting Party has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material
respects with the servicing criteria applicable to those vendors. The Asserting
Party requires these vendors to provide to the Asserting Party a Report on Assessment
of Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, as the means of assessing
our compliance with Servicing Criterion 1122 (d)(1)(ii). The Asserting Party
has not identified and is not aware of any material instances of noncompliance
by the vendors. 

The
Asserting Party has assessed its compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party
has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria
as of December 31, 2023, and for the Reporting Period with respect to the
Platforms taken as a whole. 

RSM
US LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria for the reporting period as set forth in this assertion.

RE: Management s
Report on Assessment of 2023 Compliance by 

 Park Bridge Lender
Services LLC with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria 

Park Bridge Lender
Services LLC (the Asserting Party or PBLS is responsible for
assessing its compliance, as of and for the calendar year ended December
31, 2023 (the Reporting Period ), with the servicing criteria set forth
in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations. 

The transactions
covered by this assertion are those transactions processed by the Asserting
Party in its capacity as trust advisor or operating advisor for the
asset-backed securities transactions listed in Exhibit A attached hereto
(the Platform ). 

The Asserting Party
is responsible for assessing its compliance with the servicing criteria
applicable to it. The Asserting Party used the criteria in paragraph (d)
of Item 1122 of Regulation AB (17 C.F.R. 229.1122) to assess its compliance. 
The full outline of the Asserting Party s contractually applicable servicing
criteria under various securitization pooling and servicing agreements can be
found in Exhibit B attached hereto. The servicing criteria listed
in the column title Inapplicable Servicing Criteria on Exhibit B 
hereto are not applicable to the Asserting Party based on the activities it
performs with respect to the Platform. 

Based on its
assessment, the Asserting Party believes that, as of and for the periods
the contractual obligations existed for the Platform in the Reporting Period
listed in Exhibit A, the Asserting Party has complied in all material
respects with the servicing criteria listed in the column titled Applicable
Servicing Criteria on Exhibit B hereto (the Applicable
Servicing Criteria ). 

Forvis, LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare Corporate Trust-
CMBS Platform 

The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company,
National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management
has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing
platform for the period as follows: 

Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells
Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its
Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ).
Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS
systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. 

For the CMBS Platform (defined
below) transactions and during the Period (defined below), the Company either
(i) served directly in the related trustee, securities administration, paying
agent, and/or related roles (collectively, the CMBS Platform Roles ),
or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS
Platform Roles. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo
CTS business on November 1, 2021, including during the Period, the Company has (i)
closed new CMBS transactions and (ii) completed the transfer of certain CMBS
transaction roles from Wells Fargo CTS to Computershare, for which, in each
case, during all or a portion of the Period, the Company performed the related
CMBS Platform Roles directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). 
The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the
overall CMBS Platform transactions for the Period. For a significant majority
of CMBS Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the
Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform
Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). For the Company s
Agent Role Transactions, Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the
Period, transferred to Computershare the CMBS Platform Roles for the Company s
Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a
portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for
such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role
Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a
party participating in the servicing function with respect to the CMBS
Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing
its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant
to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the CMBS Platform, as
of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

Period : As
of January 1, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of commercial mortgage-backed
securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage
loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in
the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration
statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the
issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to
an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it
acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an
assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any
transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ). Appendix A 
identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting
the CMBS Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria : All servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to either the Company s obligations, or
the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in
either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS
Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ),
except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii),
1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not
applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the CMBS Platform for
the Period; provided however that, with respect to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing
criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations related
to the aggregation of information received and the conveyance of such
information, in each case, as required by the transaction agreements, and (b) servicing
criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations
related to the process of making or effecting an addition, removal or
substitution to the asset pool in accordance with the transaction agreements (the
 Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 

Third
parties classified as vendors : 
With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company engaged a vendor
to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing obligations required by the
servicing criterion. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for
transactions in the CMBS Platform, the Company engaged, at times during the
Period, one vendor, and at other times during the Period, two vendors, in each
case to make certain payments by check to investors and/or third parties, and
to safeguard certain unissued checks. In each case, Management has determined
that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to each vendor
as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has
policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that
the activities of each vendor comply in all material respects with the
servicing criterion applicable to each vendor. Management is solely
responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to
apply C DI 200.06 for each vendor and the related servicing criterion.

With respect to the CMBS
Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the
Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. 
 Management is responsible for
assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. 
 Management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing
criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 , as
described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria
set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item
1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), and 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has
determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with
respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that
would require the Company to perform such activities. 

4. 
 Based on such assessment for the
Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare Corporate Trust -
Document Custody Platform 

The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National
Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has
determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform
for the period as follows: 

Purchase of corporate trust
business . On November 1, 2021, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold
substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to
the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and
Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with
the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of
Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices
transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 

For the Document Custody
Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period (defined below),
the Company either (i) served directly in the related document custody services
role (collectively, the Document Custody Platform Role ), or (ii)
served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody
Platform Role. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS
business on November 1, 2021, including during the Period, the Company has (i) closed
new document custody transactions and (ii) completed the transfer of certain
document custody transaction roles from Wells Fargo CTS to Computershare, for
which, in each case, during all or a portion of the Period, the Company
performed the related Document Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s
Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions
comprise a minority of the overall Document Custody Platform transactions for
the Period. For a significant majority of the Document Custody Platform
transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as
agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform
Role (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). For the Company s Agent
Role Transactions, Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period,
transferred to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role, and therefore
the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of
Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a
result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo
have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing
function with respect to the Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the
Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing
activities performed by the Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of
and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

Period : As
of January 1, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed
securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company provides document custody
services , either directly in the related role for such
services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for
which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and
ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to
a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions
were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption
from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has
an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB;
provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the
offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity,
other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(the Document Custody Platform ). Appendix A identifies the
individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria : Management has determined
that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the Company s
obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately
acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with
respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s
Obligations provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform,
servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the
Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related
to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction
agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management has
determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not
applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the Document Custody Platform
for the Period. 

Third parties classified as
vendors : With respect to servicing
criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), for certain ABS transactions included
in the Document Custody Platform, the Company has engaged a vendor to handle
certain aspects of maintaining and safeguarding pool assets, the security
thereon, and related documents as required by such servicing criteria. 
Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii) applicable to this vendor as permitted by the
SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors
Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining
that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for
the vendor and the related servicing criteria. 

With respect to the Document
Custody Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment
of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. 
 Management is responsible for
assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. 
 Management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the
servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI
200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used
the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph
(d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no
activities performed during the Period with respect to the Document Custody
Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the
Company to perform such activities. 

4. 
 Based on such assessment for the Period,
the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Period.

Management
Assessment Report 

Management
of Wilmington Trust National Association (the Company) is responsible for
assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Items
1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(3)(i) of Regulation AB of the Securities and
Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of mortgage related asset-backed
transactions initiated or amended for purposes of Regulation AB on or after
January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee services (the Platform)
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management has determined that
all other criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the
servicing activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform.
Appendix A to this report identifies the mortgage related asset-backed
transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. 

The
Company s management has assessed the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. In making
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in criterion (d)(2)(iii) and (d)(3)(i) of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB. The activities the Company performs with respect to the
applicable 1122(d) servicing criteria are listed on the attached Appendix A. 

With
respect to the Company s obligation to issue a notification to be included in
the client s Form 8-K, Form 10-D and Form 10-K under applicable servicing
criterion 1122(d)(3)(i), there were no activities performed during the year
ended December 31, 2023, with respect to the Platform, because there were no
occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities. 

With
respect to the Company s obligation to advance funds or guarantees regarding
collections, cash flows or distributions, and any interest or other fees
charged for such services for advances under applicable servicing criterion
1122(d)(2)(iii), there were no activities performed during the year ended
December 31, 2023 with respect to the Platform, because there were no
occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities. 

Based
on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2023, the Company has complied in all material respects with the
servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(3)(i) of
Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the
servicing of the Platform. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with
respect to management s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

MANAGEMENT'S
ASSERTION ON 

 COMPLIANCE WITH
REGULATION AB SERVICING CRITERIA 

KeyBank
National Association, as successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital
Markets, Inc. (the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing
compliance for the transactions listed on Appendix A for the period January 1,
2023 through December 31, 2023 (the Reporting Period ), with the
servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of
Federal Regulations (the CFR ), except for the servicing criteria
which the Asserting Party has concluded are not applicable, as indicated on
Appendix B attached hereto (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ), to
the servicing of the transactions listed on Appendix A, backed by commercial
real estate mortgage loans and serviced by the Asserting Party. Although the
Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance with Section 229.1122
(d)(l)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by
the Asserting Party during the year ended December 31, 2023, that required this
servicing criteria to be complied with. 

The
Asserting Party has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party has
complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria for
the transactions listed on Appendix A backed by commercial real estate mortgage
loans serviced by the Asserting Party. 

The
Asserting Party has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by the
servicing criteria as set forth in Appendix B. The Asserting Party has
determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined
in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Asserting Party has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section
200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06. As permitted
by C DI 200.06, the Asserting Party has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's
activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable
to the vendor. The Asserting Party is solely responsible for determining that
it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and
related criteria. 

Ernst
 Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Board of Directors, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s
Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria,
that Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC Bank, National Association Midland or the Company ), complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for all
transactions serviced on the Enterprise! Loan Management System (the
 Platform as of December 31, 2023 and for the year then ended excluding
criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D),
1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the
Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed
by them with respect to the Platform. Midland s management is responsible for
its assertion and for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on
our examination. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i),
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi),
1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged
certain vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria.
The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered servicers as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06
of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules
adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company
has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material
respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is
solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all
material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed
transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected
servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the
Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures
were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by
the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts
calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report.
We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Midland complied with the
aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2023 for all transactions serviced on the Enterprise! Loan
Management System is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of

Management
Committee 

 Greystone
Servicing Company LLC and Subsidiaries 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s
Report on Assessment of 2023 Compliance with Applicable Regulation AB Servicing
Criteria (Management s Assertion), that Greystone Servicing Company LLC and
Subsidiaries (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC) Regulation AB
for services by the Company that are encompassed by contractual obligations to
perform Regulation AB reporting (the Platforms), including only those
asset-backed securities transactions defined below, as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2023, excluding the criteria set forth in Appendix II, which
management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the
Company with respect to the Platforms covered by this report. Appendix I to
management s assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions
defined by management as constituting the Platforms. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our
examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of
the servicing activities related to the Platforms, determining whether the
Company performed those activities in compliance with the servicing criteria
during the specified period and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to
selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset- backed transaction in the
Platforms. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance
arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above
that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the
Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our
examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does
not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the
servicing criteria. 

As
described in Management s Assertion, for servicing criterion 1122 (d)(1)(ii),
the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities required by this
servicing criterion. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criterion applicable to these vendors as permitted by Section 200.06
of the Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (Section 200.06). As permitted
by Section 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures
in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities
comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to
these vendors. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets
the SEC requirements to apply Section 200.06 for the vendors and related
criterion as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with
respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Section
200.06. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Greystone Servicing Company LLC and
Subsidiaries complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, for the Platforms is fairly
stated, in all material respects.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Rialto
Capital Advisors, LLC: 

We
have examined management of Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC s assertion, included
in the accompanying Management s Assertions on Compliance with Applicable
Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC (the
 Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial
mortgage loan platform (the Platform ), excluding criteria in Items 1122
(d)(1)(iii), (d)(3)(i.C), (d)(3)(i.D), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), (d)(3)(iv),
(d)(4)(v), (d)(4)(ix), (d)(4)(x), (d)(4)(xii), (d)(4)(xiii), (d)(4)(xiv), and
(d)(4)(xv) (the servicing criteria ), as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023, which management has determined are not applicable to the activities
performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Exhibit 1 to
management s assertion identifies the individual asset backed transactions
defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible
for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria and its assertion. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the
Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material
respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a
sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the
servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were
limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset backed transaction included in the
Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance
arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above
that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the
Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence
we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria Item
1122(d)(1)(ii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities
required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these
vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted
by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors
Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06,
the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all
material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors. The
Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for these vendors and related criteria as
described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the
Company s determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023, for the commercial mortgage loan platform, is fairly stated, in all
material respects.

Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for all
transactions for specific pools identified in Exhibit A that are backed by
certain commercial mortgage loans for which the Company processed in its
capacity as trust advisor or operating advisor (the Platform ), excluding
criteria 1122(d)(1)(i) 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(i)-1122(d)(2)(vii),
1122(d)(3)(ii)-1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i) 1122(d)(4)(vi) and
1122(d)(4)(viii)-1122(d)(4)(xv), which management has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the
Platform, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of

Servicing Criteria dated February 12, 2024 as of and for the year ended

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the
Company s compliance with the specified requirements based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the specified requirements is fairly stated, in all material
respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence
about whether management s assertion is fairly stated, in all material
respects. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on
our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
management s assertion, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the
evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the specified requirements. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned applicable servicing criteria included in the accompanying Management s
Report on Assessment of Compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB Servicing Criteria dated February 12, 2024 as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Audit Committee of
Computershare Trust Company, National Association 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate Trust - CMBS Platform 
that Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company complied
with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and
Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage-backed
securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans
and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in
the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration
statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the
issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to
an exemption from registration and either the Company (and/or the party for
whom it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to
deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform
excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued,
sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.
government or any government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ), as of December
31, 2023 and for the year then ended (the Period ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not
applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party
for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related
transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period (as
applicable, the Company s Obligations provided however that, with respect
to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only
to the Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received
and the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the
transaction agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is
applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the process of making
or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in
accordance with the transaction agreements. 

As described in management's
assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company
has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB,
and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB
and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation
200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted
that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Appendix A to management's
assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities
defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. 

The Company s management is
responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination
included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that
comprise the CMBS Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to
the CMBS Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected
transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect
noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent
to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe
that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be
independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with
the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December
31, 2023 for the CMBS Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors and
Shareholder 

 KeyBank National Association 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion on Compliance
with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that KeyBank National Association, as
successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc., (the Company)
complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for commercial real estate
mortgage loans platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, except
for Item 1122 (d)(3)(i)(b), 1122 (d)(3)(i)(c), 1122 (d)(3)(i)(d), 1122
(d)(3)(ii), 1122 (d)(3)(iii) and 1122 (d)(3)(iv), which the Company has determined
are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the
servicing platform covered by this report as noted in Appendix B of
management s assertion. See Appendix A of management s assertion for the asset
backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the
Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the
individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria
and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of
the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the
selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during
the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to
determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our
tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by
the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected
transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for
assessing compliance with Item 1122 (d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no
servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December
31, 2023 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe
that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We are required to be
independent of Key Bank National Association and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related
to our examination engagement. 

Our examination does not
provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria. 

As described in management s
assertion, for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi), the Company has engaged a
vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing criteria. The
Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by
C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures
in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities
comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the
vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as
described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the
Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In our opinion, the Company complied
with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122
(d)(4)(xi) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as
described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Members of 

 LNR
Partners, LLC: 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management
Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria
included on Appendix A, that LNR Partners, LLC (the Company complied with
the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial mortgaged backed securities
transactions for which the Company served as special servicer and that were
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the
 Platform ), excluding criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), (3)(i)(C), (3)(i)(D),
(3)(ii), (3)(iii), (3)(iv), (4)(v), (4)(ix), (4)(x), (4)(xi), (4)(xii),
(4)(xiii), (4)(xiv) and (4) (xv) (the servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2023, which management has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the
Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the
servicing criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the
servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material
respects, an examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence
about management s assertion on compliance with the servicing criteria. The
nature, timing and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment,
including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of management s
assertion on compliance with the servicing criteria, whether due to error or
fraud, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a
sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the
servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were
limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have
included servicing activities related to each asset backed transaction included
in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect
noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period
specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe
that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria Item
1122(d)(2)(vii), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain activities
required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this
vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation
AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s
 Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company
has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material
respects with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor. The Company is
solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023, for the commercial mortgage backed securities Platform is fairly stated,
in all material respects.
