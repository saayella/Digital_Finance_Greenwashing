 In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York, IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank (together, IKB) in New York state court, and Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light s claims and certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG each appealed the district court s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Phoenix Light dismissed its appeal in May 2023, terminating its case. In November 2023, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into an agreement with IKB to resolve IKB s claims. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations.

2023 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria 
 
 Management of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of commercial and multifamily loans (the Platform ), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. Appendix A to this letter identifies the commercial mortgage and multifamily pools and other structures involving the commercial and multifamily loans constituting the Platform. Appendix B to this letter identifies the applicable servicing criteria with respect to the Platform. 
 
 With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company performs applicable activities covered by these criteria, with respect to the Platform, except the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain tax payment activities. Such vendor has provided a separate Regulation AB Item 1122 management assessment and attestation for such activities. 
 
 With respect to applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2023, with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 
 With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company s management has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company s management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06) (formerly SEC Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations 17.06). The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company s management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria.

The Company s management has assessed the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 
 
 The Company has not identified and is not aware of any material instance of noncompliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2023, or for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 
 
 The Company has not identified any material deficiency in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2023, or for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 
 
 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

MANAGEMENT S ASSERTION ON 
 COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION AB SERVICING CRITERIA 

KeyBank National Association, as successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc. (the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance for the transactions listed on Appendix A for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023 (the Reporting Period ), with the servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations (the CFR ), except for the servicing criteria which the Asserting Party has concluded are not applicable, as indicated on Appendix B attached hereto (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ), to the servicing of the transactions listed on Appendix A, backed by commercial real estate mortgage loans and serviced by the Asserting Party. Although the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance with Section 229.1122 (d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Asserting Party during the year ended December 31, 2023, that required this servicing criteria to be complied with. 
 
 The Asserting Party has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria for the transactions listed on Appendix A backed by commercial real estate mortgage loans serviced by the Asserting Party. 
 
 The Asserting Party has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by the servicing criteria as set forth in Appendix B. The Asserting Party has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Asserting Party has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to the vendor as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Asserting Party has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. The Asserting Party is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria. 
 
 Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

The full outline of the Asserting Party s contractually applicable servicing criteria under various securitization pooling and servicing agreements can be found in Exhibit B attached hereto. The servicing criteria listed in the column title Inapplicable Servicing Criteria on Exhibit B hereto are not applicable to the Asserting Party based on the activities it performs with respect to the Platform. 
 Based on its assessment, the Asserting Party believes that, as of and for the periods the contractual obligations existed for the Platform in the Reporting Period listed in Exhibit A, the Asserting Party has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria listed in the column titled Applicable Servicing Criteria on Exhibit B hereto (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 
 Forvis, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its roles on the Document Custody Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo had not transferred to Computershare its document custody related roles, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the Document Custody Platform transactions. During all or a portion of the Period, for all the Document Custody Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities performed by Computershare for the Document Custody Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

[1] In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 
 Computershare Corporate Trust - Document Custody Platform 
 
 The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 
 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 
 For the Document Custody Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period (defined below), the Company either (i) served directly in the related document custody services role (collectively, the Document Custody Platform Role ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, including during the Period, the Company has (i) closed new document custody transactions and (ii) completed the transfer of certain document custody transaction roles from Wells Fargo CTS to Computershare, for which, in each case, during all or a portion of the Period, the Company performed the related Document Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a minority of the overall Document Custody Platform transactions for the Period. For a significant majority of the Document Custody Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). For the Company s Agent Role Transactions, Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 
 Period : As of January 1, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 
 Platform : The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company provides document custody services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an 

exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the Document Custody Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document Custody Platform for the Period. 
 Applicable Servicing Criteria : Management has determined that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ); provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform, servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period. 
 Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), for certain ABS transactions included in the Document Custody Platform, the Company has engaged a vendor to handle certain aspects of maintaining and safeguarding pool assets, the security thereon, and related documents as required by such servicing criteria. Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii) applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and the related servicing criteria. 
 With respect to the Document Custody Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 
 1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 2. Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 
 3. With respect to Applicable Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the Document Custody Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 4. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Appendix A- 15 

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its roles on the CMBS Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo had not transferred to Computershare the roles associated with its trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related services, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the CMBS Platform transactions. During all or a portion of the Period, for all the CMBS Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the CMBS Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities performed by Computershare for the CMBS Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the CMBS Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

[1] In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 
 Computershare Corporate Trust- CMBS Platform 
 The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 
 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 
 For the CMBS Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period (defined below), the Company either (i) served directly in the related trustee, securities administration, paying agent, and/or related roles (collectively, the CMBS Platform Roles ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform Roles. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, including during the Period, the Company has (i) closed new CMBS transactions and (ii) completed the transfer of certain CMBS transaction roles from Wells Fargo CTS to Computershare, for which, in each case, during all or a portion of the Period, the Company performed the related CMBS Platform Roles directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall CMBS Platform transactions for the Period. For a significant majority of CMBS Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). For the Company s Agent Role Transactions, Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the CMBS Platform Roles for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the CMBS Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the CMBS Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 
 Period : As of January 1, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 
 Platform : The platform consists of commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the 

U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the CMBS Platform for the Period. 
 Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ), except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received and the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the transaction agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the process of making or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 
 Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company engaged a vendor to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing obligations required by the servicing criterion. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for transactions in the CMBS Platform, the Company engaged, at times during the Period, one vendor, and at other times during the Period, two vendors, in each case to make certain payments by check to investors and/or third parties, and to safeguard certain unissued checks. In each case, Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the activities of each vendor comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to each vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for each vendor and the related servicing criterion. 
 With respect to the CMBS Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 
 1.	Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 2.	Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 , as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 
 3.	With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), and 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 4.	Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 The Board of Directors 
 Wells Fargo Bank, National Association: 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying 2023 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria) for Commercial and Multifamily Loans (the Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company has determined that servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii) are applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform, except for certain tax payment activities that the Company has engaged various vendors to perform. With respect to applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), the Company has determined that there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2023 with respect to the Platform because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to the 2023 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 
 As described in the accompanying 2023 Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), and for certain activities related to 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure

Interpretation (C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related servicing criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

See Appendix A of management's assertion for the asset backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Item 1122 (d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during 
 1 A member firm of Ernst Young Global Limited 

the year ended December 31, 2023 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 We are required to be independent of Key Bank National Association and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to the vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 
 
 In our opinion, the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Executive Director Pentalpha Surveillance LLC 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of 2023 Compliance by Pentalpha Surveillance LLC with Applicable Regulation AB Servicing Criteria (Management s Assertion), that Pentalpha Surveillance LLC (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC) Regulation AB for services by the Company that are encompassed by contractual obligations to perform Regulation AB reporting (Platforms A and B), including only those asset-backed securities transactions defined below, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, excluding the following criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(1)(i-v), 1122(d)(2)(i-vii), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(i-vi) and 1122(d)(4)(viii-xv) for 
 Platform A, and servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i-v), 1122(d)(2)(i-vii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(i-vi) and 1122(d)(4)(viii-xv) for Platform B, which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platforms covered by this report. Appendix B to management s assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions defined by management as constituting Platforms A and B. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to Platforms A and B, determining whether the Company performed those activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset- backed transaction in Platforms A and B. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that Pentalpha Surveillance LLC complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, for Platforms A and B is fairly stated, in all material respects.

The Platform consists of the asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management in its Management s Report. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities constituting the Platform and evaluating whether the Company performed servicing activities related to those transactions and securities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the period covered by this report. Accordingly, our testing may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction or security constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was not designed to detect material noncompliance that may have occurred prior to the period covered by this report and that may have affected the Company s servicing activities during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. 
 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 
 
 As described in Management s Report, the Company engaged various vendors to perform servicing activities with respect to criteria 1122(d)(2)(vii). The Company determined that each vendor is not considered a servicer, as that term is defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and therefore, the Company is assuming responsibility 

for compliance with such servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s servicing activities. In accordance with Regulation AB and its related interpretations, the requirement for management to assess compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to a vendor s activities is satisfied if the Company has instituted policies and procedures to monitor whether such vendor s activities comply in all material respects with such criteria. Compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is achieved if those policies and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such vendor s activities comply with such criteria and those policies and procedures are operating effectively for the period covered by Management s Report. Our examination does not provide a legal determination of whether a vendor is or is not considered a servicer, and therefore, on whether the Company, in its Management Report, is eligible to elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s servicing activities. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that Argentic Services Company LP complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

The Company s management is responsible for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the specified requirements based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the specified requirements is fairly stated, in all material respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether management s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of management s assertion, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the specified requirements. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria included in the accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB Servicing Criteria dated February 12, 2024 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Board of Directors Wells Fargo Bank, National Association: 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA, that the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company was appointed to provide document custody services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the Document Custody Platform as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Appendix A to the ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Document Custody Platform. 
 The Company s management has determined that the following servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company with respect to the Document Custody Platform as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023: Item 1122(d)(1)(ii) and 1122(d)(1)(iv) (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). The Company s management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the Company because the Company does not perform activities with respect to the Document Custody Platform relating to those servicing criteria. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, 
 KPMG LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. 

on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Document Custody Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Document Custody Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects. 
 We do not express an opinion or any form of assurance on the statements in Appendix B to the ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Audit Committee of Computershare Trust Company, National Association 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate Trust - Document Custody Platform that Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company provides document custody services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the Document Custody Platform ), as of December 31, 2023 and for the year then ended (the Period ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(i); 1122(d)(1)(iii); 1122(d)(1)(v); 1122(d)(2)(i-vii); 1122(d)(3)(i-iv); and 1122(d)(4)(iv-xv), which Management has determined are not applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ); provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction agreements. 
 As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Document Custody Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Document Custody Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Document Custody Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Audit Committee of Computershare Trust Company, National Association 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate Trust - CMBS Platform that Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and either the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ), as of December 31, 2023 and for the year then ended (the Period ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ); provided however that, with respect to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received and the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the transaction agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the process of making or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in accordance with the transaction agreements. 
 As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 

Appendix A to management's assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. 
 The Company s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the CMBS Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the CMBS Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
