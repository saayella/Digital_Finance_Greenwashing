Item 1117 of Regulation AB 
 Disclosure from Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee: 
 
 Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company DBNTC have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of certain residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. 
 
 On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed an action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court alleging that DBNTC and DBTCA failed to perform purported duties, as trustees for 544 private-label RMBS trusts, to enforce breaches of representations and warranties as to mortgage loans held by the trusts and to enforce breaches by servicers of their mortgage loan servicing obligations for the trusts. During the course of the litigation, plaintiffs dismissed the case from New York State Supreme Court and refiled two separate cases, one in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the BlackRock SDNY Case and the other in the Superior Court of California, Orange County (the BlackRock California Case ). Pursuant to a settlement among the parties, the BlackRock SDNY Case was dismissed on December 6, 2018, and the BlackRock California Case was dismissed on January 11, 2019. 
 
 On September 27, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by certain special purpose entities including Phoenix Light SF Limited in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which the plaintiffs previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 43 of the trusts at issue. On September 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for one of the 43 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 42 trusts at issue. Plaintiffs third amended complaint brings claims for violation of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 TIA ); breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence and gross negligence; violation of New York s Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the third amended complaint, plaintiffs acknowledge that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed plaintiffs TIA Act claims, negligence and gross negligence claims, Streit Act claims, claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and certain theories of plaintiffs breach of contract claims, and plaintiffs only include these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. Plaintiffs allege damages of hundreds of millions of dollars. On November 13, 2017, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the third amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, plaintiffs, jointly with Commerzbank AG (see description of Commerzbank case below), filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On October 27, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment relating to plaintiffs standing. On February 8, 2022, the court issued an order in which it granted DBNTC and DBTCA s supplemental motion for summary judgment, granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s initial motion for summary judgment, and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, all of plaintiffs claims were dismissed with prejudice. On April 26, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the court s summary judgment order. 
 
 On November 30, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case brought by Commerzbank AG Commerzbank in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which Commerzbank previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 50 of the trusts at issue. On November 30, 2017, Commerzbank filed a second amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for 1 of the 50 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 49 trusts at issue. Commerzbank s second amended complaint brings claims for violation of the TIA; breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence; violation of the Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the second amended complaint, Commerzbank acknowledges that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed Commerzbank s TIA claims for the trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements, as well as its Streit Act claims and claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and Commerzbank only includes these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. The second amended complaint alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA caused Commerzbank to suffer hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. On January 29, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the second amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, Commerzbank, jointly with the Phoenix Light plaintiffs, filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On February 8, 2022, the court issued an order in which it granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, many of plaintiffs claims and theories were dismissed with prejudice. Discovery is ongoing. 
 
 On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, IKB ), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. On May 27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, violation of the Streit Act, violation of the TIA, violation of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over U.S. 268 million in damages. On October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss. On January 6, 2017 and June 20, 2017, IKB voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims as to seven trusts. On January 27, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion to dismiss. The court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to IKB s claims for violations of the Streit Act, Regulation AB, and Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as certain aspects of IKB s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the TIA. The court 
 6 

denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. IKB s remaining claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of the TIA will proceed. On May 10, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a notice of appeal with the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department, regarding certain aspects of the court s order on the motion to dismiss. On May 20, 2021, IKB filed a notice of cross appeal with respect to other aspects of that order. On August 30, 2022, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department affirmed in part and reversed in part the court s order on the motion to dismiss. After DBNTC and DBTCA appealed the First Department s decision, on June 15, 2023, the New York Court of Appeals reversed the First Department s decision in part, dismissing certain additional contract claims, as well as IKB s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest. On June 2, 2021, IKB filed a motion for re-argument regarding certain aspects of the court s order on the motion to dismiss, which the court denied on August 3, 2021. On May 13, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the complaint. On October 28, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to seven additional trusts. On December 29, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to one additional trust. On April 22, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to 17 certificates at issue, including all claims as to 5 trusts. On February 28, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to two trusts, leaving 15 trusts at issue. On November 21, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to three trusts, leaving 12 trusts at issue. Discovery is ongoing. 
 
 It is DBTCA s belief that it has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on DBTCA s present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties under the related servicing agreement for this transaction. 
 Disclosure from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association Wells Fargo Bank (i) as custodian for the Vertex Pharmaceuticals HQ mortgage loan under the WFCM 2016-BNK1 PSA, (ii) as custodian for the Opry Mills mortgage loan under the JPMCC 2016-JP2 PSA, (iii) as trustee and custodian for the Staybridge Suites Times Square mortgage loan under the DBJPM 2016-C3 PSA, (iv) as custodian for the Kroger (Roundy s) Distribution Center mortgage loan under the WFCM 2016-C35 PSA and (v) as trustee and custodian for the Jay Scutti Plaza mortgage loan under the CSAIL 2016-C6 PSA: 
 
 In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of New York, IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank (together, IKB) in New York state court, and Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light s claims and certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG each appealed the district court s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Phoenix Light dismissed its appeal in May 2023, terminating its case. In November 2023, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into an agreement with IKB to resolve IKB s claims. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations.

 With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company performs applicable activities covered by these criteria, with respect to the Platform, except the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain tax payment activities. Such vendor has provided a separate Regulation AB Item 1122 management assessment and attestation for such activities. 
 
 With respect to applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2023, with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 
 With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company s management has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company s management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06) (formerly SEC Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations 17.06). The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company s management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria.

The Company s management has assessed the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 
 
 The Company has not identified and is not aware of any material instance of noncompliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2023, or for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 
 
 The Company has not identified any material deficiency in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2023, or for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 
 
 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 RE: 	Management s Report on Assessment of 2023 Compliance by 
 Park Bridge Lender Services LLC with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria 

Park Bridge Lender Services LLC (the Asserting Party or PBLS is responsible for assessing its compliance, as of and for the calendar year ended December 31, 2023 (the Reporting Period ), with the servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations. 
 The transactions covered by this assertion are those transactions processed by the Asserting Party in its capacity as trust advisor or operating advisor for the asset-backed securities transactions listed in Exhibit A attached hereto (the Platform ). 
 The Asserting Party is responsible for assessing its compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it. The Asserting Party used the criteria in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB (17 C.F.R. 229.1122) to assess its compliance. The full outline of the Asserting Party s contractually applicable servicing criteria under various securitization pooling and servicing agreements can be found in Exhibit B attached hereto. The servicing criteria listed in the column title Inapplicable Servicing Criteria on Exhibit B hereto are not applicable to the Asserting Party based on the activities it performs with respect to the Platform. 
 Based on its assessment, the Asserting Party believes that, as of and for the periods the contractual obligations existed for the Platform in the Reporting Period listed in Exhibit A, the Asserting Party has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria listed in the column titled Applicable Servicing Criteria on Exhibit B hereto (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 
 Forvis, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

Management of Wilmington Trust National Association (the Company) is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(3)(i) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of mortgage related asset-backed transactions initiated or amended for purposes of Regulation AB on or after January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee services (the Platform) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management has determined that all other criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. 
 
 Appendix A to this report identifies the mortgage related asset-backed transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. 
 
 The Company s management has assessed the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in criterion (d)(2)(iii) and (d)(3)(i) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. The activities the Company performs with respect to the applicable 1122(d) servicing criteria are listed on the attached Appendix A. 
 
 With respect to the Company s obligation to issue a notification to be included in the client s Form 8-K, Form 10-D and Form 10-K under applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i), there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2023, with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 
 With respect to the Company s obligation to advance funds or guarantees regarding collections, cash flows or distributions, and any interest or other fees charged for such services for advances under applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(iii), there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2023 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities.

Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(3)(i) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its roles on the Document Custody Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo had not transferred to Computershare its document custody related roles, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the Document Custody Platform transactions. During all or a portion of the Period, for all the Document Custody Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities performed by Computershare for the Document Custody Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

[1] In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 
 Computershare Corporate Trust - Document Custody Platform 
 
 The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 
 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 
 For the Document Custody Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period (defined below), the Company either (i) served directly in the related document custody services role (collectively, the Document Custody Platform Role ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, including during the Period, the Company has (i) closed new document custody transactions and (ii) completed the transfer of certain document custody transaction roles from Wells Fargo CTS to Computershare, for which, in each case, during all or a portion of the Period, the Company performed the related Document Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a minority of the overall Document Custody Platform transactions for the Period. For a significant majority of the Document Custody Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). For the Company s Agent Role Transactions, Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 
 Period : As of January 1, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 
 Platform : The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company provides document custody services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an 

exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the Document Custody Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document Custody Platform for the Period. 
 Applicable Servicing Criteria : Management has determined that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ); provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform, servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period. 
 Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), for certain ABS transactions included in the Document Custody Platform, the Company has engaged a vendor to handle certain aspects of maintaining and safeguarding pool assets, the security thereon, and related documents as required by such servicing criteria. Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii) applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and the related servicing criteria. 
 With respect to the Document Custody Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 
 1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 2. Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 
 3. With respect to Applicable Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the Document Custody Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 4. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its roles on the CMBS Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo had not transferred to Computershare the roles associated with its trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related services, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the CMBS Platform transactions. During all or a portion of the Period, for all the CMBS Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the CMBS Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities performed by Computershare for the CMBS Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the CMBS Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 

[1] In this Assessment, the term subservicer means agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 
 Computershare Corporate Trust- CMBS Platform 
 The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 
 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 
 For the CMBS Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period (defined below), the Company either (i) served directly in the related trustee, securities administration, paying agent, and/or related roles (collectively, the CMBS Platform Roles ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform Roles. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, including during the Period, the Company has (i) closed new CMBS transactions and (ii) completed the transfer of certain CMBS transaction roles from Wells Fargo CTS to Computershare, for which, in each case, during all or a portion of the Period, the Company performed the related CMBS Platform Roles directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall CMBS Platform transactions for the Period. For a significant majority of CMBS Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). For the Company s Agent Role Transactions, Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the CMBS Platform Roles for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the CMBS Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the CMBS Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 
 Period : As of January 1, 2023 through and including December 31, 2023 (the Period ). 
 Platform : The platform consists of commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the 

U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the CMBS Platform for the Period. 
 Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ), except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received and the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the transaction agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the process of making or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 
 Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company engaged a vendor to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing obligations required by the servicing criterion. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for transactions in the CMBS Platform, the Company engaged, at times during the Period, one vendor, and at other times during the Period, two vendors, in each case to make certain payments by check to investors and/or third parties, and to safeguard certain unissued checks. In each case, Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the activities of each vendor comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to each vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for each vendor and the related servicing criterion. 
 With respect to the CMBS Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 
 1.	Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 2.	Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 , as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 
 3.	With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), and 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 4.	Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC Bank, National Association Midland or the Company ), complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for all transactions serviced on the Enterprise! Loan Management System (the Platform as of December 31, 2023 and for the year then ended excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by them with respect to the Platform. Midland s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company has engaged certain vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, for the commercial mortgage loan platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

The Company s management is responsible for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the specified requirements based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the specified requirements is fairly stated, in all material respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether management s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of management s assertion, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the specified requirements. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria included in the accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB Servicing Criteria dated February 12, 2024 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

To the Management of CoreLogic Solutions, LLC: 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that CoreLogic Solutions, LLC. (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage loan outsourcing customers for which the Company served as the tax service provider (the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(i iii), 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(2)(iii iv), 1122(d)(3)(i iv), 1122(d)(4)(i x), and 1122(d)(4)(xii xv), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. The Platform consists of the transactions performed for commercial mortgage loan outsourcing customers for which the Company served as the tax service provider. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities constituting the Platform and evaluating whether the Company performed servicing activities related to those transactions and securities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the period covered by this report. Accordingly, our testing may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction or security constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was not designed to detect material noncompliance that may have occurred prior to the period covered by this report and that may have affected the Company s servicing activities during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 

GT.COM	 Grant Thornton LLP is the U.S. member firm of Grant Thornton International Ltd (GTIL). GTIL and each of its member firms are separate legal entities and are not a worldwide partnership 

In our opinion, management s assertion that CoreLogic Solutions, LLC complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the commercial mortgage loan outsourcing customers for which the Company served as the tax service provider is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Management of Wilmington Trust National Association 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assessment Report, that Wilmington Trust National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for Items 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(3)(i) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the servicing of mortgage related asset-backed transactions initiated or amended for purposes of Regulation AB on or after January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee services (the Platform ), as of December 31, 2023, and for the year then ended. Appendix A to Management s Assessment Report identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities and applicable criteria defined by management as constituting the Platform. Wilmington Trust National Association s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement.

 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria included on Appendix A, that LNR Partners, LLC (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the commercial mortgaged backed securities transactions for which the Company served as special servicer and that were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Platform ), excluding criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), (3)(i)(C), (3)(i)(D), (3)(ii), (3)(iii), (3)(iv), (4)(v), (4)(ix), (4)(x), (4)(xi), (4)(xii), (4)(xiii), (4)(xiv) and (4) (xv) (the servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, an examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about management s assertion on compliance with the servicing criteria. The nature, timing and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of management s assertion on compliance with the servicing criteria, whether due to error or fraud, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset backed transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria Item 1122(d)(2)(vii), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain activities required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria 

applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, for the commercial mortgage backed securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
