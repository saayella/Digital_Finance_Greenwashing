We use our in-house resources to build, maintain and oversee some of our technology systems. We believe this approach enhances our operations and improves cost efficiencies.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1393612_0001393612-24-000010.txt|43|Seasonality In our credit card business, we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns around the winter holidays, summer vacations and back-to-school periods. Historically, in our private student loan business, our loan disbursements peaked at the beginning of a school s academic semester or quarter; we stopped accepting new applications for private student loans February 1, 2024. Seasonal trends have not caused significant fluctuations in our results of operations or credit quality metrics between quarterly and annual periods. Revenues in our Diners Club business are generally higher in the first half of the year as a result of Diners Club s tiered pricing system where licensees qualify for lower royalty rate tiers as cumulative volume grows during the course of the year. Competition The consumer financial services business is highly competitive.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1393612_0001393612-24-000010.txt|44|We compete with other consumer financial services providers, including non-traditional providers such as financial technology firms and payment networks, based on several factors, including brand, reputation, customer service, product and service offerings, incentives, pricing, e-commerce and digital wallet participation, and other terms. Our credit card business also competes on the basis of reward programs and merchant acceptance. We compete for accounts and utilization with cards issued by other financial institutions (including American Express, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Capital One and Citibank) and, to a lesser extent, businesses that issue their own private label cards or otherwise extend credit to their customers. In comparison to our largest credit card competitors, our strengths include no annual fees, cash rewards, conservative portfolio management and strong, 100 U.S.-based customer service. Competition based on rewards and other card features and benefits continues to be strong.

Our home loan product faces competition primarily from national and regional mortgage lenders. Our credit card receivables continue to represent a majority of our receivables. The credit card business is highly competitive. Some of our competitors offer a wider variety of financial products than we do, which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1393612_0001393612-24-000010.txt|46|Some of our competitors enjoy greater financial resources, diversification and scale than we do and are therefore able to invest more in initiatives and technology to attract and retain customers, such as advertising, targeted marketing, account acquisitions and pricing offerings in interest rates, annual fees, reward programs and low-priced balance transfer programs. In addition, some of our competitors have assets such as branch locations and co-brand relationships that may help them compete more effectively. Another competitive factor in the credit card business is the increasing use of debit cards as an alternative to credit cards for purchases. -9- Table of Contents Merchant acceptance of the Discover card has increased in the past several years to reach near parity in the U.S. for both the number of merchants enabled for acceptance and the number of merchants actively accepting Discover.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1393612_0001393612-24-000010.txt|47|However, the legacy perception of lower acceptance still presents limitations in attracting new cardholders and debit card issuers. Most domestically-issued credit cards, other than those issued on the American Express network, are issued on the Visa and MasterCard networks, thus most other card issuers benefit from the dominant market share of Visa and MasterCard. We continue to make investments in expanding Discover and Diners Club acceptance in key international markets where an acceptance gap exists. In our payment services business, we compete with other networks for volume and to attract network partners to issue credit, debit and prepaid cards on the Discover, PULSE and Diners Club networks. We generally compete on the basis of customization of services and various pricing strategies, including incentives and rebates.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1393612_0001393612-24-000010.txt|48|We also compete on the basis of issuer fees, fees paid to networks (including switch fees), merchant acceptance, network functionality, customer perception of service quality, brand image, reputation and market share. The Discover and Diners Club networks primary competitors are Visa, MasterCard and American Express. PULSE s network competitors include Visa s Interlink, MasterCard s Maestro and First Data s STAR. American Express is a particularly strong competitor to Diners Club as both cards target international business travelers. As the payments industry continues to evolve, we are also facing ongoing competition from financial technology firms and alternative payment solutions, which leverage new technologies and a customer s existing deposit and credit card accounts and bank relationships to create payment or other fee-based solutions.

When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. We buy most of our merchandise directly from suppliers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from suppliers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses.

Our core payment network supports what is often referred to as a four-party payments network and includes the following participants: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuer (the account holder s financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant s financial institution). We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants acceptance of our products.

The following graphic depicts a typical transaction on our core payment network and our role in that transaction, which includes payments ecosystem security, value-added services and the enablement of digital payments: In a typical transaction, an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products. After the transaction is authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below) and other applicable fees, and then posts the transaction to the account holder s account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the merchant discount rate), to the merchant. Interchange Fees.

Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred. These costs are incurred by issuers in providing services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants, whose participation in the network enables increased sales to their existing and new customers, efficiencies in the delivery of existing and new products, guaranteed payments and improved customer experience. We (or, alternatively, financial institutions) establish default interchange fees that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.

In addition to operating our own validator nodes to provide staking services, we utilize third-party service providers to operate validator nodes on our customers behalf. 9 Because staking rewards depend on the relevant protocol and network conditions, the estimated rewards rate for each asset made available for staking is displayed on our website and through our platform, and is calculated by periodically consulting onchain data to determine the total amount earned by our stakers. We only facilitate staking of a user s crypto assets in response to a direct instruction from that user, and they remain the property of the user while staked, and a user s staked crypto assets remain in our custody.

Valuations of our equity investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions could result in additional volatility.

Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities.

Our ability to operate successfully and meet the needs of our customers in an efficient and cost-effective way was due in significant part to our investments over the past several years aimed at creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds. Going forward, we will continue to leverage the momentum of these investments and invest in our business in support of the following goals: We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement and develop differentiated capabilities for our customers; We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider in home improvement; and We intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement.

OUR CORE BUSINESS In a typical Visa C2B payment transaction, the consumer purchases goods or services from a merchant using a Visa card or payment product. The merchant presents the transaction data to an acquirer, usually a bank or third-party processing firm that supports acceptance of Visa cards or payment products, for verification and processing. Through VisaNet, the acquirer presents the transaction data to Visa, which in turn sends the transaction data to the issuer to check the account holder s account balance or credit line for authorization.

Our compliance and risk management methods, as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations, may not be effective, which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators or other legal proceedings. Our ability to comply with existing and future rules, regulations and laws largely depends on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. Regulators periodically review our ability to self-regulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including self-regulatory standards.

In addition, given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems, a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. The extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, which may compound damages before the incident is discovered or remediated.

We realized strong momentum in member and product growth and cross-buy adds, reflecting the benefits of our broad product suite and Financial Services Productivity Loop strategy.

We also added approximately 3.2 million new products, with over 11.1 million total products as of December 31, 2023, a 41 year over year increase. Lending segment contribution profit of 823.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, at a margin of 60 , increased 24 over 2022, which had a contribution margin of 58 . Total net revenue of 1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 20 over 2022. Additionally, average net interest margin of 5.88 in 2023 increased 48 basis points compared to 5.40 in 2022.
20240227_10-K_edgar_data_1818874_0001818874-24-000026.txt|3|Growth in net interest income was driven by an increase in both average interest-earning assets and average yields, partially offset by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Origination volume increased 34 year over year, primarily driven by demand for personal loans and despite continued macroeconomic headwinds in the student and home loan businesses. Student loans saw some increasing demand in the third quarter of 2023 ahead of the resumption of principal and interest payments on federally-held student loans, and we expect that we may continue to see modest growth in student loan refinancing. Our acquisition of Wyndham in the second quarter of 2023 provided increased capacity and capabilities for our home loans product, which contributed to a notable year over year increase in home loans, and which we expect to continue to provide benefits, while we expect overall home loans growth could be correlated with rate movements in 2024. 85 SoFi Technologies, Inc.

Growth was driven by continued strong organic growth of existing partners and new product adoption, as well as notable contributions from increasingly diversified clients which have launched within the second half of 2023. Margin improvements were driven primarily by Galileo account growth and decreases in directly attributable expenses, as we begin to realize the benefits of earlier investments made to support Technology Platform product development and the integration of Galileo and Technisys. The year over year comparison was also impacted by a partial period of contribution from Technisys in 2022 compared to a full period of contribution in 2023. We continue to make significant strides in our strategy of leveraging our unique product suite to pursue diversified growth and expansion via new products and geographies, in addition to larger, more durable revenue opportunities.

Within Financial Services, contribution loss of 0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 significantly improved compared to a contribution loss of 199.4 million in 2022, and reflected positive contribution profit during the third and fourth quarters of 2023. Total net revenue of 436.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 160 over 2022. We achieved continued strong growth in deposits, ending the year with 18.6 billion of deposits as of December 31, 2023, allowing us to maintain diversified sources of funding and driving an increase in net interest income earned on our deposits. In addition, we grew total Financial Services products by 45 year over year.

We expect to continue to scale our products through increased brand awareness and network effects, and continue to improve contribution profit in the segment. The strength of our results underscores our belief that our suite of differentiated products and services provides the foundation for a diversified business that can endure through market cycles as well as exogenous factors. For instance, our access to multiple channels of funding, including deposit and loan warehouse funding, provides an advantage via increased optionality in sourcing liquidity through different environments and periods of capital markets volatility, as well as increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin and optimize returns, which typically provides more stable earnings in any macroeconomic environment but is particularly important during times of excess macroeconomic volatility. During 2023, we continued to have strong deposit contribution from direct deposit members with a high quality median FICO score.

We implemented an FTP framework to attribute net interest income to our business segments based on their usage and/or provision of funding, under which Lending segment net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our loans and an FTP charge for the segment s use of funds to originate loans, which can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates, funding curves, the composition of our balance sheet and the availability of capital. See Note 20. Business Segment and Geographic Information to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the FTP framework. Technology Platform Segment We earn technology products and solutions fees for providing an integrated platform as a service for financial and non-financial institutions.

In certain of our contracts, we provide for a variety of integrated platform services, which vary by client and are either non-cancellable or cancellable with a substantive payment. Pricing structures under these contracts are typically volume-based, or a combination of activity and volume-based, and payment terms are predominantly monthly in arrears. Many of these contracts contain minimum monthly payments, which may result in credits if we do not meet the agreed upon monthly service levels. We also earn subscription and service fees for providing software licenses and associated services, including implementation, maintenance and subsequent development work.

We also earn referral fulfillment fees for providing pre-qualified borrower referrals to a third-party partner who separately contracts with a loan originator. Our referral fee is calculated as either a fixed price per successful referral or a percentage of the transaction volume between the enterprise partners and referred consumers. Interchange fees: We earn interchange fees from our SoFi-branded debit cards and credit cards. These fees are remitted by merchants and represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value processed through a payment network.

Brokerage fees: We earn brokerage fees primarily from our share lending and payment for order flow arrangements related to our SoFi Invest product, in which we benefit through a negotiated multi-year revenue sharing arrangement, since our members' brokerage activity drives the share lending and payment for order flow volume. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Our management and Board of Directors use adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, formulate business plans, help better assess our overall liquidity position and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors . Adjusted Net Revenue Adjusted net revenue is defined as total net revenue, adjusted to exclude the fair value changes in servicing rights and residual interests classified as debt due to valuation inputs and assumptions changes, which relate only to our Lending segment, as well as gains and losses on extinguishment of debt.

This measure helps provide our management with an understanding of the net revenue available to finance our operations and helps management better decide on the proper expenses to authorize for each of our operating segments, to ultimately help achieve target contribution profit margins. Therefore, the measure of adjusted net revenue serves as both the starting point for how we think about the liquidity generated from our operations and also the starting point for our annual financial planning, the latter of which focuses on the cash we expect to generate from our operating segments to help fund the current year s strategic objectives. Adjusted net revenue has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as total net revenue. The primary limitation of adjusted net revenue is its lack of comparability to other companies that do not utilize this measure or that use a similar measure that is defined in a different manner.

Our employees drive the company s value proposition, innovate better ways to serve our clients and act as custodians of our reputation. We seek to empower our employees by providing development and learning opportunities to help each person reach their full potential, by promoting an inclusive, diverse and equitable workplace and by improving organizational effectiveness. In 2023, we continued to execute on our human capital strategy, as described in the sections below.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|13|Our employee population at December 31, 2023 increased approximately 10 compared to December 31, 2022 to approximately 46,000 employees. This increase was almost entirely driven by the consolidation of one of our operations joint ventures in India in the fourth quarter of 2023, as described below in this Human Capital section. Approximately 74 of our employees are located outside the United States. The Board of Directors Human Resources Committee oversees our human capital management strategy, and receives regular updates on matters such as recruitment, retention, development, culture and inclusion, diversity and equity initiatives. Our Enterprise Talent Management Committee, which consists of senior executives, provides leadership, input and advice on our global talent-related initiatives to support our strategic priority to continually seek to become a higher-performing organization.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|14|Organizational Effectiveness Driving improvements in both individual and organizational productivity is a key enabler of our overall human capital management strategy, and we are focused on strategic workforce planning, building upon current headcount budgeting and forecasting activities. Our productivity efforts aim to promote the optimal cost and efficiency of our human capital through clear alignment between our business strategy and our organizational structure, headcount, personnel expense, geographic footprint, performance management, people development and reward systems. We focus on cultivating a high performing workforce that is adept at achieving profitable growth, responsive to changing business needs, and structured and resourced to deliver desired outcomes. Professional development and employee learning are necessary to achieve our human capital goals, and we seek to align our learning and development offerings with our corporate strategy as described in more detail below under Attracting and Retaining Top Talent. We believe that improving the productivity of our workforce and strengthening our operational and execution focus will yield more engaged and higher performing employees and optimize our ability to serve our clients, grow revenues and improve operating margin.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|15|In 2023, we continued to streamline and increase the efficiency of our operations to drive sustained productivity improvements, which we expect to enable us to further enhance our client service model. As noted above, in the fourth quarter of 2023, as part of ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, we completed the consolidation of one of our operations joint ventures in India. Subsequently in 2023, we announced plans to assume full ownership of a second operations joint venture in India, which is expected to be completed in 2024 and further streamline our operating model in India. Workforce Engagement and Culture Our culture and values help to define us as a company and provide employees with a clear and compelling value proposition. Our culture traits provide a blueprint for employees in carrying out their work: Choose to Own It; Break Through Silos; Deliver Results with Integrity and Speed; Do Better Every Day; and Care for Our Colleagues, Clients and Community.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|16|We aim to promote strong levels of employee commitment and connection to the company by highlighting our shared culture traits and the behaviors that drive our business strategy. Our leadership training programs are designed to embed these culture traits into our development processes. We also provide multiple avenues for recognition of employees who role-model our culture traits, such as through our Risk Excellence Awards, which recognize and reward employees who demonstrate exemplary risk management behaviors. Through our Bravo program, employees recognized their colleagues over 118,000 times for outstanding work in 2023. We believe that a culture where employees feel valued, engaged and empowered makes State Street a more desirable place to work, helps us attract key talent and retain employees as they grow in their careers, fostering an environment that enhances each individual s productivity and professional satisfaction.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|17|We use our compensation program to incentivize our executives to role-model these shared culture traits. In determining executive compensation, we first measure enterprise-level performance. We then evaluate executives performance against individual objectives derived from our corporate goals, including their performance advancing and role-modeling the critical leadership behaviors and culture traits that drive our business strategy. State Street Corporation | 9 The integrity and ethical decision-making of our employees is also paramount for our culture and we want our employees to know their opinions are valued, to feel comfortable asking questions and raising concerns, and to have no fear of retaliation. We encourage employees to speak up if they see behavior that is inconsistent with our Standard of Conduct, policies, culture or values, and we regularly communicate the multiple channels provided for them to do so, including our Speak Up Line (which can be used to report anonymous concerns), Global Human Resources team and other avenues.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|18|Reports are provided to State Street s Lead Director, General Counsel and General Auditor, depending on the nature of the reported concern. Encouraging professional challenge and debate is also a key leadership behavior that we use in evaluating candidates for executive promotions. Our approach is to promote ethical conduct by treating minor policy breaches as learning opportunities, and treating major policy breaches and misconduct promptly, professionally and seriously. Attracting and Retaining Top Talent Our talent management efforts are focused on developing and retaining top talent and industry leaders in markets that align with current and future demands and the evolution of our business. Retention and ongoing development of our talent requires competitive compensation and benefits, a wide range of learning and development offerings, strong support by engaged and well-trained leaders and managers and a culture where employees feel valued, engaged and empowered.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|19|As such, we carefully monitor our hiring, promotion and turnover rates and implement programs to help retain and develop our employees. In 2023, we continued to focus on our strategic workforce planning efforts to improve internal mobility, upskilling employees capable of expanding or changing their contributions, and limiting our external hiring to priority areas. Through our various internal mobility efforts, more than one-third of open roles in 2023 were filled with internal candidates. Hiring managers have visibility into internal talent pools, allowing us to continue to leverage our global employee population as our talent source. As a critical component of our ability to attract and retain employees, we regularly monitor our compensation program to maintain competitiveness.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|20|Our overall aim with respect to compensation is to reward high performance, motivate employees and provide competitive incentive opportunities. Compensation typically comprises fixed compensation, which reflects individual skills and abilities relative to role requirements, and variable compensation, which is designed to link total compensation to organizational, business line, risk management and individual performance. Our compensation program is intended to drive our business strategy by differentiating pay based on performance, including, as described above, the performance of our executives in advancing and role-modeling the leadership behaviors and culture traits that drive that strategy. Professional development and employee learning are also key elements of our talent retention strategy. We seek to align our learning and development offerings with our corporate strategy by offering skill enhancement opportunities addressing the rapidly changing, technology-centric demands of the financial services industry.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|21|This includes structured, pre-defined learning-pathways like the Global Delivery Academy, which provides standardized technical training support for new employees, as well as individual access to a wide range of learning offerings that allow manager and employee to define a personalized development journey. We also provide professional development opportunities and access to enhanced or new roles to help deepen our employees skillsets and provide them with a broader perspective on the company. Inclusion, Diversity and Equity Inclusion, diversity and equity have long been a focus for our company, and we aim to deliver programs, resources and support that foster an environment in which every employee feels valued, inspired and empowered to leverage their diverse experiences and identities to provide innovative and authentic service to our clients, community and each other. We believe that our strength comes from our diversity, including with respect to disability, gender, LGBTQ+ identity, race and veteran status, and our objective is to attract, hire and promote the best person for each job, positioning us to be an essential partner to our clients. We established enterprise-wide multi-year diversity goals for gender (globally) and employees who are black, indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) (United States only) in 2017.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|22|In 2023, we made progress compared to 2022 in six of the eight goal categories. Although we fell short of achieving all of our diversity goals, we achieved five of our eight goals, including all of our goals for BIPOC employees in the United States in 2023. We are proud of our progress and continue to integrate key learnings as we prepare to establish our next set of multi-year goals. We are also focused on transparency and accountability and publish information about our inclusion, diversity and equity-related goals and activities on our website because we believe that maintaining transparency about where we are and where we have more work to do is an important part of holding ourselves accountable. We also publish our EEO-1 demographic data and pay equity information on our website.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|23|We continue to accelerate progress via our 10 Actions Against Racism and Inequality, which we established in July 2020. These concrete actions State Street Corporation | 10 include goals to increase our Black and Latinx representation among our senior leaders, while addressing racial and social injustice and inequity by enhancing inclusion and diversity within our own company and advocating for the same in our industry and communities. In 2023, we announced our achievement of Management Leadership for Tomorrow s (MLT) Black Equity at Work Bronze Certification. State Street became the first global SIFI to earn this designation, which focuses on rigorous action with accountability, development and implementation of a comprehensive Black equity plan. At the end of 2023, our global workforce was approximately 56 men and 44 women, and women represented approximately 39 of our leadership (defined as senior vice president level and above).
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|24|In the United States, approximately 37 of our workforce self-identified as members of the BIPOC community. Community Engagement Through our community engagement programs, we aim to benefit the communities where our employees work and live, develop employees professional and leadership skills, and increase employee engagement and retention through meaningful volunteer opportunities that affirm a sense of purpose and demonstrate alignment with our values. We are proud of our impact on communities around the world through employee volunteering and the financial support of State Street Foundation to non-profit organizations. We provide training and support for State Street employees to serve as members of boards of directors of charitable organizations, expanding their leadership skills through community service. Our skills-based volunteer program gives employees the opportunity to strengthen their communities while also improving their professional skills in alignment with our overall human capital management strategy.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|25|Additionally, our matching gifts program recognizes the employees' contributions in the community by monetizing volunteer time, matching personal donations and supporting employee fundraising efforts. We believe that being a good corporate citizen drives employee engagement, enhances our reputation with clients and potential employees, improves brand recognition and builds public trust. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION We are registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Bank Holding Company Act generally limits the activities in which bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries may engage to managing or controlling banks and to a range of activities that are considered to be closely related to banking. Bank holding companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding companies, such as the Parent Company, may engage in a broader range of activities considered to be financial in nature.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|26|The regulatory limits on our activities also apply to non-banking entities that we are deemed to control for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act, which may include companies of which we own or control 5 or more of a class of voting shares. The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company to terminate any activity, or its ownership or control of a non-banking subsidiary, if the Federal Reserve finds that the activity, ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a banking subsidiary or is inconsistent with sound banking principles or statutory purposes. The Bank Holding Company Act also requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it acquires substantially all the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares of any bank. The Parent Company has elected to be treated as a financial holding company and, as such, may engage in a broader range of non-banking activities than permitted for bank holding companies and their subsidiaries that have not elected to become financial holding companies. Financial holding companies may engage directly or indirectly, either de novo or by acquisition, in activities that are defined by the Federal Reserve to be financial in nature, provided that the financial holding company gives the Federal Reserve after-the-fact notice of the new activities.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|27|Activities defined to be financial in nature include, but are not limited to: providing financial or investment advice; underwriting; dealing in or making markets in securities; making merchant banking investments, subject to significant limitations; and any activities previously found by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. In order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, we and each of our U.S. depository institution subsidiaries are expected to be well capitalized and well managed, as defined in applicable regulations and determined in part by the results of regulatory examinations, and must comply with Community Reinvestment Act obligations. Failure to maintain these standards may result in restrictions on our activities and may ultimately permit the Federal Reserve to take enforcement actions against us and restrict our ability to engage in activities defined to be financial in nature. State Street Corporation | 11 In response to the 2008 financial crisis, as well as other factors, such as technological and market changes, both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject has increased.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|28|Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. Subsequently, in 2018, the EGRRCPA was enacted. The EGRRCPA s revisions to the U.S. financial regulatory framework have altered certain laws and regulations applicable to us and other major financial services firms.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|29|Changes in key personnel at the federal banking agencies that regulate such banking organizations, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC (U.S. Agencies), may result in increased prudential and conduct oversight, more extensive regulatory requirements, changing interpretations of existing rules and guidelines, and potentially more stringent enforcement and more severe penalties. Irrespective of any regulatory change, we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. In addition, increased regulatory requirements and initiatives have been and are being implemented globally with respect to financial institutions, including the implementation of the Basel III rule (refer to Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards in this Supervision and Regulation section and under Capital in Financial Condition in our Management's Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K for a discussion of Basel III, as well as the U.S. Agencies proposed rule regarding the Basel III endgame), the Capital Requirements Directive and Capital Requirements Regulation and the E.U.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|30|Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), as well as proposals for amending the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and under the Capital Markets Union Action Plan. Many aspects of our business are subject to regulation by other U.S. federal and state governmental and regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations (including securities exchanges), and by non-U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Some aspects of our public disclosure, corporate governance principles and internal control systems are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations and rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|31|Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards Basel III Rule We are subject to the Basel III framework (Basel III rule) in the United States. The provisions of the Basel III rule related to minimum capital requirements, capital buffers and deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital were fully implemented as of January 2019. We are also subject to the market risk capital rule as implemented by U.S. banking regulators. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, we are subject to a capital floor, also referred to as the Collins Amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|32|Thus, our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer described below in this Supervision and Regulation section. On July 27, 2023, the U.S. Agencies issued a proposed rule to implement the Basel III endgame (Basel III Endgame Proposal) for large banks, and separately proposed revisions to the U.S. G-SIB capital surcharge framework (G-SIB Surcharge Proposal).
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|34|The Basel III Endgame Proposal includes an effective date of July 1, 2025, with three-year transition arrangements until the requirements are fully phased in on July 1, 2028. The G-SIB Surcharge Proposal is set to be implemented two calendar quarters after the date of the adoption of the final rule, which is currently to be determined. Based on our current understanding of the Basel III Endgame Proposal, we estimate that, if the expanded risk-based approach had been applied on a fully phased-in basis as of December 31, 2023, and in the absence of taking any actions to mitigate its impact, our expanded risk-based approach RWA as of that date would have been approximately 15 higher than our actual standardized approach RWA as of that date. Any estimate of how the expanded risk-based approach may impact us is subject to uncertainty, as actual results may differ from the anticipated results and may be materially affected by and dependent on a range of factors, including business performance, future capital actions, the results of future supervisory stress tests, and interpretations (including changes in interpretations) of, and potential modifications by the U.S. Agencies to, the proposal.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|35|Risk Weighted Assets The existing Basel III rule provides two frameworks for the calculation of RWA for purposes of bank regulatory compliance: the standardized approach and the advanced approaches, which are applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. The standardized approach prescribes standardized risk weights for certain on- and off-balance sheet exposures in the calculation of RWA. The advanced approaches consist of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach (AIRB) used for the calculation of RWA related to credit risk and the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) used for the calculation of RWA related to operational risk. In November 2019, the U.S. Agencies issued a final rule that, among other things, implements the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), a methodology for calculating the exposure amount for derivative contracts.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|36|Under the final rule, beginning on January 1, 2022, we had the option to use the SA-CCR or the Internal Model Methodology (IMM) to measure the exposure amount of our cleared and uncleared derivative transactions under our advanced approaches calculation. We have elected to use the SA-CCR for purposes of our advanced approaches capital calculations. Since January 1, 2022, we are required to determine the amount of these exposures under our standardized approach capital calculation using the SA-CCR. Minimum Risk-Based Capital Requirements Among other things, the Basel III rule (as amended) requires: a minimum CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 and a minimum SLR of 3 for advanced approaches banking organizations; a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 ; a minimum total capital ratio of 8 ; and the stress capital and countercyclical capital buffers, referenced below, as well as a G-SIB surcharge and the enhanced SLR (which acts as an SLR buffer) described in Capital in Financial Condition in our Management's Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K. Under the Basel III rule, our total regulatory capital is composed of three tiers: CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital (which includes CET1 capital), and Tier 2 capital.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|37|The total of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, adjusted as applicable, is referred to as total regulatory capital. CET1 capital is composed of core capital elements, such as qualifying common shareholders' equity and related surplus plus retained earnings and the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation plus net unrealized gains (losses) on debt and equity securities classified as AFS, less treasury stock and less goodwill and other intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tier 1 capital is composed of CET1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital instruments which, for us, includes four series of preferred equity outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Tier 2 capital includes certain eligible subordinated long-term debt instruments. Total regulatory capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|38|Certain other items, if applicable, must be deducted from Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, including certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated banking, financial and insurance entities and the amount of expected credit losses that exceeds recorded allowances for loan and other credit losses. Expected credit losses are calculated for wholesale credit exposures by formula in conformity with the Basel III rule. State Street Corporation | 13 G-SIB Surcharge The eight U.S. bank holding companies deemed to be G-SIBs, including us, are required to calculate the G-SIB surcharge annually according to two methods, and be bound by the higher of the two: Method 1: Assesses systemic importance based upon five equally-weighted components: size, interconnectedness, complexity, cross-jurisdictional activity and substitutability; or Method 2: Alters the calculation from Method 1 by factoring in a short-term wholesale funding score in place of substitutability and applying a fixed coefficient to each of the five components. Method 2 is the binding methodology for us as of December 31, 2023.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|39|Our current G-SIB surcharge, through December 31, 2024, is 1.0 . Based upon preliminary calculations using data as of December 31, 2023, we currently anticipate that our surcharge will remain at 1 through December 31, 2025; however, that calculation has not yet been finalized and is subject to many financial, balance sheet, market and other factors, and consequently there is a risk that a higher G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 will result from the final calculation. As noted above, our G-SIB surcharge must be calculated annually, and year-over-year changes in our Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB scores may therefore result in changes to our G-SIB surcharge. If our Method 1 or Method 2 score changes year-over-year such that we would become subject to a higher surcharge, the higher surcharge would not become effective for two years from the as of date (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated as of December 31, 2023 would not become effective until January 1, 2026). If, however, our Method 1 or Method 2 score changes year-over-year such that we would become subject to a lower surcharge, we would be subject to the lower surcharge beginning one full year from the as of date (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated as of December 31, 2023 would become effective January 1, 2025).
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|40|Stress Capital Buffer On March 4, 2020, the U.S. Agencies issued the SCB final rule that replaced, under the standardized approach, the fixed capital conservation buffer (2.5 with an SCB calculated as the difference between the institution s starting and lowest projected CET1 ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve s supervisory stress test plus planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh quarter of the supervisory stress testing planning horizon. Based on our results from the 2023 supervisory stress test, our SCB for the period of October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 is set at the prescribed minimum of 2.5 of RWA. For additional information about the SCB final rule, refer to Capital Planning, Stress Tests and Dividends in this Supervision and Regulation section. Under the SCB final rule, a banking organization would be able to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments without specified quantitative limitations (although subject to other potential regulatory constraints, such as supervisory limitations), as long as it maintains its required SCB plus the applicable G-SIB surcharge (plus any potentially applicable countercyclical capital buffer) over the minimum required risk-based capital ratios and as long as it satisfies all leverage based capital requirements and buffers.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|41|From time to time, under certain economic conditions, banking regulators may establish a minimum countercyclical capital buffer up to a maximum of 2.5 of total RWA. The countercyclical capital buffer was initially set by banking regulators at zero, and has not been increased since its inception. Assuming a countercyclical buffer of 0 , the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2024, including a capital conservation buffer and an SCB of 2.5 for advanced and standardized approaches, respectively, and a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0 , are 8.0 for CET1 capital, 9.5 for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 11.5 for total risk-based capital, in order for us to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments without limitation. Leverage Ratios We are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and SLR. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and adjusted quarterly average on-balance sheet assets.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|42|The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the SLR primarily in that the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly average of on-balance sheet assets, while the SLR additionally includes off-balance sheet exposures. We must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 . We are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3 , and as a U.S. G-SIB, we must maintain a 2 SLR buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. If we do not maintain this buffer, limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|43|In November 2019, pursuant to the EGRRCPA, the U.S. Agencies adopted a final rule that excludes central bank deposits from a custodial banking organization s total leverage exposure for purpose of calculating the SLR. This exclusion is not applicable to total leverage exposure under the calculation of Tier 1 leverage. This exclusion is equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have State Street Corporation | 14 on deposit at qualifying central banks and (ii) the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts. The rule became effective on April 1, 2020.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|44|For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we excluded 69.6 billion of average balances held on deposit at central banks from the denominator used in the calculation of our SLR based on this custodial banking exclusion. The TLAC and LTD that State Street is required to hold under SLR-based requirements reflect the exclusion of certain central bank balances as a consequence of the rule. The SA-CCR final rule that went into effect for us on January 1, 2022, also requires us to incorporate the SA-CCR into the calculation of our total leverage exposure for the purpose of calculating SLR. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal Reserve has implemented rules on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as us.
20240215_10-K_edgar_data_93751_0000093751-24-000498.txt|45|The requirements are intended to improve the resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through enhanced prudential standards. The TLAC rule imposes: (1) external TLAC requirements (i.e., combined eligible Tier 1 regulatory capital and LTD); (2) separate external LTD requirements; and (3) clean holding company requirements that impose restrictions on certain types of liabilities and limit non-TLAC related third party liabilities to 5 of external TLAC.

We report LCR to the Federal Reserve daily and are required to calculate and maintain an LCR that is equal to or greater than 100 . In addition, we publicly disclose certain qualitative and quantitative information about our LCR consistent with the quarterly disclosure requirements of the Federal Reserve's final rule.

In addition, the level of HQLA we are required to maintain under the LCR is dependent upon our client relationships and the nature of services we provide, which may change over time. Deposits resulting from certain services provided operational deposits are treated as more resilient during periods of stress than other deposits. As a result, if balances of operational deposits increased relative to our total client deposit base, we would expect to require less HQLA in order to maintain our LCR. Conversely, if balances of operational deposits decreased relative to our total client deposit base, we would expect to require more HQLA.

In addition, under the Federal Reserve s capital plan rule, we must conduct periodic stress testing of our business operations and submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by us and by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve conducts a qualitative assessment of our capital plan as part of the annual supervisory process known as CCAR, to evaluate the strength of our capital planning practices, including our ability to identify, measure, and determine the appropriate amount of capital for our risks, and controls and governance supporting capital planning. The Federal Reserve's final SCB rule to integrate its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements applies to certain bank holding companies, including us.

Risked-based regulatory capital requirements under the standardized approach include the SCB, as summarized above, as well as our G-SIB capital surcharge and any applicable countercyclical capital buffer. The final rule made related changes to capital planning and stress testing processes for bank holding companies subject to the SCB requirement. In particular, the final rule assumes that bank holding companies maintain a constant level of assets and RWA throughout the supervisory stress test projection period. In addition, under the final rule the supervisory stress test no longer assumes that bank holding companies make all nine quarters of planned capital distributions under stress, although the SCB incorporates the dollar amount of four quarters of planned common stock dividends, as described above.

The capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, including the minimum ratios under the Basel III rule, and serve as a source of strength to State Street Bank under supervisory stress scenarios. Changes in our strategy, merger or acquisition activity or unanticipated uses of capital could result in a change in our capital plan and its associated capital actions, including capital raises or modifications to planned capital actions, such as repurchases of our stock, and may require resubmission of the capital plan to the Federal Reserve if, among other reasons, we would not meet our regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. In addition to its stress testing and capital planning requirements, the Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends, the repurchase of common stock, or other capital actions that reduce capital by the banking State Street Corporation | 16 organizations it supervises, including the Parent Company and State Street Bank, if, in the Federal Reserve s opinion, the capital action would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of-the financial condition of the banking organization.

We are also required to undergo an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve. The EGRRCPA modifies certain aspects of these stress-testing requirements, reducing the number of scenarios in the Federal Reserve s supervisory stress test from three to two and modifying our obligation to perform company-run stress-tests from semi-annually to annually.

Purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023, the Company had purchase obligations of approximately 735 million, of which 280 million is payable within 12 months. 57 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1364742_0000950170-24-019271.txt|49|These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by the Company s application of accounting policies. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. Consolidation The Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1364742_0000950170-24-019271.txt|50|The company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary PB of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity s legal organization, the entity s capital structure, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company s involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert absolute control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50 voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1364742_0000950170-24-019271.txt|51|BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it (1) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. In addition, the Company s ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as on-going redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10 or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once its economic interest falls below 10 . As of December 31, 2023, the Company was deemed to be the PB of approximately 100 VIEs.

Fair Value Measurements The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , and Note 7, Fair Value Disclosures , in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements. Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on 7.1 billion of investments will impact the Company s nonoperating income (expense), 709 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining 2.0 billion relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense).
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1364742_0000950170-24-019271.txt|53|At December 31, 2023, changes in fair value of 4.1 billion of CIPs will impact BlackRock s net income (loss) attributable to NCI on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock s net exposure to changes in fair value of CIPs was 2.2 billion. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1364742_0000950170-24-019271.txt|54|The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2023 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2023, the Company s common stock closed at 811.80, which exceeded its book value of 264.96 per share. Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open-end investment funds, collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1364742_0000950170-24-019271.txt|55|The assignment of indefinite lives to such contracts primarily is based upon the following: (1) the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these products; (2) the Company expects to, and has the ability to, continue to operate these products indefinitely; (3) the products have multiple investors and are not reliant on a single investor or small group of investors for their continued operation; (4) current competitive factors and economic conditions do not indicate a finite life; and (5) there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles if they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. Finite-lived intangible assets represent finite-lived investor/customer relationships, technology related assets, and management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds, that are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the Company for a specified period of time. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2023 ranged from approximately 1 to 10 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of approximately 5 years.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1364742_0000950170-24-019271.txt|56|The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired at least annually, as of July 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset might be impaired. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant quantitative factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considered other qualitative factors including: (1) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (2) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the Company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (3) Company-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset, which is generally determined using an income approach, is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. 58 For finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1364742_0000950170-24-019271.txt|57|Factors included in evaluating finite-lived customer relationships, technology related assets and trade names include technology services revenue trends, customer attrition rates, obsolescence rates, and royalty rates. For finite-lived management contracts, evaluation is based on changes in assumptions including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current estimated fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1364742_0000950170-24-019271.txt|58|A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company s amortization expense, which was 151 million, 151 million and 147 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. The Company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes were required to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenues when its obligations related to the services are satisfied and it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue amount would not occur in future periods.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1364742_0000950170-24-019271.txt|59|The Company enters into contracts that can include multiple services, which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct. Management judgment is required in assessing the probability of significant revenue reversal and in identification of distinct services. The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows.
20240223_10-K_edgar_data_1364742_0000950170-24-019271.txt|60|AUM represents the broad range of financial assets the Company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset values). The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts ("SMAs"). These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods. Performance fees, including carried interest, are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved.

Our Spend-Centric Model and Revenue Mix Our spend-centric business model focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on our cards and secondarily through finance charges and fees. Spending on our cards, which is higher on average on a per-card basis versus our network competitors, offers superior value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and larger transactions. Because of the revenues generated from having high-spending Card Members and the annual card fees we charge on many of our products, we are able to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for Card Members, as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants. This creates incentives for Card Members to spend more on their cards and positively differentiates American Express cards.

To drive greater adoption and acceptance of VR we have also introduced MR capabilities, which allow users to experience the immersion and presence of VR while still being grounded in the physical world, through our Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 3 devices. We have continued to advance our augmented reality (AR) roadmap to include offerings such as the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which feature Meta AI, our advanced conversational assistant, as well as offer the ability to livestream video and let people stay more present through hands-free interaction. We also offer Meta Spark, a platform that allows creators and businesses to build AR experiences that bring the digital and physical worlds together in our apps. In general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the metaverse, our VR and social platform efforts also include notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to go to market, whereas our AR efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term research and development projects.

Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States, and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed. These U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.

In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.

For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the Irish Data Protection Committee (IDPC) issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR 1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the United States.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations.
20240228_10-K_edgar_data_1156375_0001156375-24-000010.txt|22|Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to the valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes and internal use software costs. Valuation of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price.
20240228_10-K_edgar_data_1156375_0001156375-24-000010.txt|23|We have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value: Level 1 inputs, which are considered the most reliable evidence of fair value, consist of quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of observable market data, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable. Level 3 inputs consist of unobservable inputs, which are derived and cannot be corroborated by market data or other entity-specific inputs. For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and note 17.

We review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions.
20240228_10-K_edgar_data_1156375_0001156375-24-000010.txt|25|These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates; forecasted operating margins; risk-adjusted discount rates; forecasted economic and market conditions; and industry multiples. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Under certain favorable circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends. In addition, the carrying value of goodwill, as denominated in foreign currencies, is adjusted each reporting period as a result of movements in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S.

Such foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity. We also review indefinite-lived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions.

We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Similar to goodwill, under certain favorable circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances.
20240228_10-K_edgar_data_1156375_0001156375-24-000010.txt|28|The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the carrying value of the amortizing asset to its undiscounted net cash flows. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. In connection with this impairment assessment, management also challenges the useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets. 35 Table of Contents Revenue recognition. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house.
20240228_10-K_edgar_data_1156375_0001156375-24-000010.txt|29|Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched, novated and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. This reserve has historically been immaterial.
20240228_10-K_edgar_data_1156375_0001156375-24-000010.txt|30|The reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as management's estimate of future adjustment activity. Income taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year, as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance.

We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed.

In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. Internal use software costs. Certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use are capitalized. We also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained or developed in the cloud.

Amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use. In addition, software assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable or that a reduction in the estimated useful lives is warranted.

Interest rate volatility was higher as a result of higher inflation levels and market uncertainty following the collapse of two U.S. regional banks as well as uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve s interest rate policy decision. The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) has raised the federal funds rate multiple times throughout 2023 and there was uncertainty regarding additional rate changes in the future. In addition, the agricultural commodities and energy markets saw an increase in volatility as a result of more weather uncertainty in 2023 compared to 2022.

Cash App Ecosystem With Cash App, we are building an ecosystem of financial products and services that helps consumers manage their money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible. Cash App is primarily in the United States and has a diverse set of customers across demographics and regions. We use our inflows framework to assess the performance of Cash App across actives, inflows per active, and the monetization rate on inflows.
20240222_10-K_edgar_data_1512673_0001628280-24-006354.txt|32|Strategic Priorities Cash App sits at the intersection of three traditionally-distinct use cases: financial services, community based transactions (peer-to-peer payments) and commerce. Our approach for Cash App is to combine these three areas together in a unique manner to define a new product category and reinvent banking for our customers. Our primary focus with Cash App, in alliance with our bank partners, is on earning the primary banking relationship of our existing customer base in the U.S. 12 Customers can use Cash App to inflow funds in a variety of ways, including by receiving money from another Cash App customer through the app s core peer-to-peer transfer service, transferring money from a bank account, depositing mobile checks, adding physical cash at participating retailers, receiving a recurring paycheck by direct deposit, and through other inflow channels.

We develop trust with customers by offering reliable, easy, and secure access to their accounts and convenient support. We also adapt the amount of funds a customer can bring in through specific channels based on risk profile, and as we improve our understanding of a customer s identity. We believe building and maintaining deep trust with our customers will drive greater product adoption and increased inflows into our ecosystem.

20240222_10-K_edgar_data_1512673_0001628280-24-006354.txt|39|Given our network scale, we believe Cash App can help bitcoin evolve beyond an asset class to an investment that possesses real transactional utility, which is why we launched our offering in 2018 with the ability to deposit and withdraw bitcoin across the blockchain. We have since added the ability for customers to send bitcoin across the Cash App network to any phone number or Cashtag, creating an easy-to-use off-chain network for bitcoin payments that settles instantly between transacting actives. We also allow U.S. actives to send and receive bitcoin to/from anyone with a compatible wallet via the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a second layer technology applied to the bitcoin blockchain that enables faster transactions with little to no fees.
20240222_10-K_edgar_data_1512673_0001628280-24-006354.txt|40|Community Peer-to-peer payments form the basis of our Community development pillar because customers engage in financial transactions with other members of the Cash App community. When customers use peer-to-peer, they are inviting their friends, family, and coworkers to download Cash App so that they can send each other money. Peer-to-peer becomes more useful for our customers as their communities expand, so our customers are naturally incentivized to bring more people into their networks. We offer the peer-to-peer service to our Cash App customers for free when a linked debit account is used to fund a transaction, as we consider peer-to-peer to be a marketing tool to encourage Cash App usage. We charge a fee to the sender when transactions are funded using a credit card, and a fee to the recipient if it is a business account.
20240222_10-K_edgar_data_1512673_0001628280-24-006354.txt|41|14 Instant Deposit was the first feature we started monetizing on Cash App. Customers are able to instantly transfer funds from Cash App to a bank account for a small fee.

We have a range of products across our BNPL platform.

We may also receive digital advertising revenue based on clicks to a merchant site from the Afterpay App as well as flat fees for premium ad placements.

We use various scalable communication channels such as email marketing, in-product notifications and messaging, and Square Communities, our online forum for sellers, to increase the awareness and usage of our products and services with little incremental sales and marketing expense.

In addition to direct channels, we work with third-party developers and other partners who offer our solutions to their customers. Partners expand our addressable market to sellers with individualized or industry-specific needs. Through the Square App Marketplace, Square partners are able to expand their own addressable market by reaching the millions of sellers using Square. As of December 31, 2023, Square had nearly 1,000 managed partners connected to its platform.
20240222_10-K_edgar_data_1512673_0001628280-24-006354.txt|48|Cash App Ecosystem Cash App has also developed a strong brand, which can be traced back to our compelling features, self-serve experience, unique design, and engaging marketing. Peer-to-peer transactions serve as the primary acquisition channel for Cash App. Peer-to-peer transactions have powerful network effects as every time a customer sends or requests money, Cash App can potentially acquire a new customer or re-engage an existing customer. We have enhanced the efficiency of peer-to-peer transfers by streamlining the onboarding process for Cash App, enabling customers to sign up in minutes. We offer the peer-to-peer service to our Cash App customers for free, and we consider it to be a marketing tool to encourage the usage of Cash App.
20240222_10-K_edgar_data_1512673_0001628280-24-006354.txt|49|We do not generate revenue on the majority of peer-to-peer transactions and for these transactions we characterize card issuance costs, peer-to-peer costs, and risk loss as a sales and marketing expense. Cash App also uses paid marketing, including referrals, advertising spend, partnerships, and social media campaigns, to expand its network, as these programs help reach new customers, enhance its brand, and improve retention among existing customers. Additionally, we see the launch and advertising of new Cash App features as an important way to attract new customers and engage existing customers. Features such as Cash App Card and Boost rewards, bitcoin buying and selling, investing in stocks and ETFs, cross-border payments, Cash App Pay, and a tax preparation service enhance Cash App s utility for customers and provide reasons for consumers to try Cash App. Product Development and Technology We design both our Square and Cash App products and services to be cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant, and we organize our product teams accordingly, combining individuals from product management, engineering, data science, analytics, design, and product marketing.

We frequently update our software products and have a rapid software release schedule with improvements deployed regularly. Our services are built on a scalable technology platform, and we place a strong emphasis on data analytics and machine learning to maximize the efficacy, efficiency, and scalability of our services. 16 In our Square ecosystem, this technology platform enables us to capture and analyze billions of transactions per year and automate risk assessment for more than 99.95 of all transactions. Our hardware is designed and developed in-house, and we contract with third-party manufacturers for production.

Our competitors range from large, well-established vendors to smaller, earlier-stage companies. We seek to differentiate ourselves from competitors primarily on the basis of our extensive commerce ecosystem and our focus on building remarkable products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant. In addition, we differentiate ourselves by offering transparent pricing, no long-term contracts, and our ability to innovate and reshape the industries we operate in to expand access to traditionally unserved or underserved sellers. With respect to each of these factors, we believe that we compare favorably to our competitors.

It is our practice to enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with other third parties, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology. In addition to these contractual measures, we also rely on a combination of trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, registered domain names, trade secrets, and patent rights to help protect our brand and our other intellectual property. We have developed a patent program and strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative aspects of our products, services, and technologies where appropriate. We also actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks, trade dress, and domain names in the United States and in other jurisdictions.

In addition, we participate in a number of industry organizations that facilitate patent pools or non-assertion commitments, such as the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance that we co-founded, LOT Network, and Open Invention Network. 17 Government Regulation Foreign and domestic legal requirements apply to many key aspects of our business. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, monetary penalties, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate. It is also possible that current or future laws or regulations could be interpreted or applied in a manner that would prohibit, alter, or impair our existing or planned products and services, or that could require costly, time-consuming, or otherwise burdensome compliance measures from us.

For example, certain jurisdictions in the United States require a license to offer money transmission services, such as Cash App s peer-to-peer payments, and we maintain a license in each of those jurisdictions and comply with new license requirements as they arise. We are also registered as a Money Services Business with the U.S. Department of Treasury s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN"). These licenses and registrations subject us, among other things, to record-keeping requirements, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and examination by state and federal regulatory agencies.

As our business continues to develop and expand, additional laws, rules and regulations may become relevant. Seasonality Historically, transaction-based revenue for our Square ecosystem has been strongest in our fourth quarter and weakest in our first quarter, as our sellers typically generate additional GPV during the holiday season.

Hardware revenue generally demonstrates less seasonality than transaction-based revenue, with most fluctuations tied to periodic product launches, promotions, or other arrangements with our retail partners. Historically, our Cash App ecosystem has experienced improvements in revenue and gross profit related to the distribution of government funds as customers have deposited more funds into Cash App during these times, including during the first quarter when U.S. tax refunds are typically distributed. Certain products within Cash App may also experience stronger fourth quarters and weaker first quarters, such as our BNPL platform, which typically generates additional revenue and gross profit during the holiday season.
20240222_10-K_edgar_data_1512673_0001628280-24-006354.txt|65|Typical seasonality trends for the Cash App ecosystem are also impacted by bitcoin revenue, which is driven by customer demand and the current market price of bitcoin, and as such, may not be indicative of future performance and skew typical seasonality trends in the Cash App ecosystem. Human Capital Our employees are a driving force behind our purpose of economic empowerment. Attracting, developing, and retaining top talent remain a focus in the development of our human capital programs. As of December 31, 2023, we had 12,985 full-time employees worldwide with 3,154 full-time employees outside the US. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed to support our operations.

We plan to operate below this cap through a combination of performance management, centralizing teams and functions to reduce duplication, and prioritization of our scope. We expect to keep this cap in place until we believe the growth of the business has meaningfully outpaced the growth of our company. We have a purpose-driven culture, with a focus on employee input and well-being, which we believe enables us to attract and retain exceptional talent. We offer learning and development programs for all employees, as well as a robust manager training program.

Our distributed work model means that we no longer have a designated headquarters location and, for the vast majority of roles, employees have the flexibility to work within or outside a Block office space. Our distributed work model has unlocked opportunities to hire and retain talent in more locations, as we can hire employees in locations where we do not have office space, and employees can continue to work for us if they need or want to relocate. A key focus of our human capital management approach is our commitment to promoting inclusion and diversity in our workplace. In 2023, we equipped managers with tools to build and lead inclusive teams, expanded professional development opportunities for employees from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds, and continued to elevate diversity as a central component of our recruiting strategy.
